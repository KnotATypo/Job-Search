** Overview **

** Junior Software Engineer – Engineering Productivity **   

Clipchamp is the go-to video platform with one simple mission: to empower
anyone to tell stories worth sharing. Since 2016 we’ve attracted over 50
million registered users globally and counting, and that’s only the beginning.
We've now joined Microsoft's Office Product Group (OPG).  
  
Building and maintaining strong connections across location and time is
critical in the world we live in, and the emotional power of media – video,
audio, and photos – makes it perfect for fostering personal connections and
sharing information.  
  
Our in-browser platform and native Windows app gives users access to
professional video editing tools and features alongside a 1 million asset-
strong stock library and hundreds of editable video templates. We're the go-to
platform that's built with everyday editors and creators in mind.  
  
** About the Team **   
  
While Clipchamp is predominantly based in Australia, OPG is a global team,
with offices in multiple countries. Joining Clipchamp means you'll join a team
of colleagues who live all around the world. We’re committed to each team
member feeling connected, regardless of where they work and live.  
  
** Clipchamp’s Technical Stack **   
  
Our video editing experience lives completely in-browser, which means pushing
the boundaries of what web technologies can do. We hold a high bar for
performance and user experience and invest in unique technologies like in-
browser file caching, video composition, and video encoders.  
  
Our frontend codebase is built on React, TypeScript, WebAssembly,
ServiceWorkers, and WebGL. On the backend we use Python and are introducing C#
for native apps and services. We deploy code to production daily, supported by
a culture of automated testing and our dedicated engineering productivity
team.  
  
Our internal developer tooling is largely Python based. We use Azure DevOps
for our CI/CD pipelines, and also work on cloud functions and applications in
Azure.

  * Proactively identifying and addressing developer experience issues and blockers to developer productivity. 
  * Contributing to improvements in our build, test, and release processes.

** Qualifications **

** Who we’re looking for: **

  * 1 year demonstrated experience in both frontend and backend development 
  * Experience and interest in automation, developer tooling, and cloud infrastructure.

  * A motivated individual with an active Github account, you love to code, and it shows!   

** Bonus points if you love: **

  * Automated testing and shortening developer feedback loops. 
  * Online video and contributing to the technically challenging problems we’re solving 
  * Maxing out what browsers can do, that’s what we’re about! We were told you can’t build a video editing platform in browser, including encoding the final video – but we did 
  * Experience with authentication, cloud computing and cloud storage
