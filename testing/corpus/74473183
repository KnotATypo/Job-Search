  * In collaboration with research teams, promote and implement participant recruitment and engagement activities, and maintain systematic participant information record keeping. 
  * Assist multi-disciplinary research project staff and coordinate all assessments and intervention episodes for projects, as per approved protocols. 
  * Liaise with Clinical Administration Officer and Faculty central functional units to organise project-related operational needs. 
  * Provide data for reporting on research outcomes, including preparation of abstracts, posters, oral presentations and publications. 
  * Monitor and report to Scientific Director and Chief Investigators on any issues related to implementation of the research program, ethical considerations, progress of data collection, compliance of research participants and/or families, implications for changes in best clinical practice (where appropriate to discipline), and any constraints arising within the research projects.
