** Learn perinatal psychology with us! **

We are big on team culture and we support opportunities for growth and
development.

At _ Three Little Birds Perinatal Psychology _ , we are committed to being the
“go to” clinic on Brisbane’s Southside for new and expecting parents. Join our
existing team of 9 clinicians coming from diverse backgrounds (Health
Psychology, Clinical Psychology, Social Work, Counselling, Ed & Dev
Psychology), as well as our multidisciplinary model of outreach support. An
iniative of POP! Psychology Inc,

The clinical work we provide is:

SYSTEMIC, NURTURING, HOPE FILLED and TRAUMA INFORMED

And we value:

FLEXIBILITY, COMMUNITY, LEARNING, and FUN

If you like the sound of that, we would love to meet you!

Our team offers mentoring and upskilling opportunities in perinatal mental
health, and a role on our team means you can make use of our professional
development opportunities ( _ Seeds of Sunshine _ series of child & youth
training, _ Full Circle _ introduction to perinatal training). Anyone with
existing clinical experience, and an interest but no experience in the
child/youth or the perinatal area can expect a serious jump in their knowledge
and practice skills after coming on board with us.

Due to our expansion with two consulting practices (Red Hill and Morningisde),
we eagerly welcome entry-level right up to senior roles. We can accommodate
the right therapist at any point in their training, though you must _
minimally _ have at least two years experience in mental health counselling.
Eligibility for medicare rebating is preferred.

Of course if you already have experience with child and family intervention /
developmental psychology / infant mental health we will have trouble
containing our excitement! You can expect generous pay conditions commensurate
with your contribution to our service, as a potential ** Senior Clinician ** .
And you know we’re serious about that because we wrote it in bold letters.
