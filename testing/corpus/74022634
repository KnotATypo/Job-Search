** The Role **

  

As a cadet, you will work with other cadets supported by ASD mentors and
supervisors.

You will work on a range of projects that contribute to Australia’s national
security. You will also undertake training to improve your skills, and get
real-world experience that you won’t get at university.

A cadetship is for university students who are currently studying an
undergraduate or postgraduate degree. You will receive an academic allowance
of $800 per subject (capped at four subjects per semester). This is paid at
the end of each semester on successful completion of subjects.

Cadets will work on a part-time basis working for a minimum of 2 days a week.
The remainder of your time will be dedicated to finishing your university
study. After successfully completing the ASD Cadetship Program, you will be
promoted into a full-time position.

Diversity powers our mission. Our work is challenging, and our history shows
that the best teams contain a diverse range of people. To achieve our mission,
we require people with strong integrity and a mix of skills, passion,
adaptability, resilience, curiosity and creativity.

We support our people to bring their best selves to work. Whether this is
through our diversity and inclusion initiatives, flexible working arrangements
or learning and development opportunities.

We are committed to the growth of our most important resource – you
