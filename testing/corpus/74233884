** Overview **

** Software Engineering Manager: Shaping the future of video **   
  
Clipchamp is the go-to video platform with one simple mission: to empower
anyone to tell stories worth sharing. Since 2016 we’ve attracted over 50
million registered users globally and counting, and that’s only the beginning.
We've now joined Microsoft's Office Product Group (OPG).  
  
Building and maintaining strong connections across location and time is
critical in the world we live in, and the emotional power of media – video,
audio, and photos – makes it perfect for fostering personal connections and
sharing information.  
  
Our in-browser platform and native Windows app gives users access to
professional video editing tools and features alongside a 1 million asset-
strong stock library and hundreds of editable video templates. We're the go-to
platform that's built with everyday editors and creators in mind.  
  
** About the Team **   
  
While Clipchamp is predominantly based in Australia, OPG is a global team,
with offices in multiple countries. Joining Clipchamp means you'll join a team
of colleagues who live all around the world. We’re committed to each team
member feeling connected, regardless of where they work and live.  
  
At Clipchamp, we endeavour to innovate. We believe the path to innovation lies
in valuing questions, craving feedback and exploring new ideas. Team members
are encouraged to take ownership and drive change, and we’ll support you in
receiving the resources needed to get the job done.

  * Ambition to get things done, now, the fast lane, no bureaucracy, idleness is boring   

** Bonus points if you love: **

  * Online video and contributing to the technically challenging problems we’re solving 
  * Maxing out what browsers can do, that’s what we’re about! We were told you can’t build a video editing platform in browser, including encoding the final video – but we did
