** About the Company **

MOA are the leading Quality and Compliance Management SaaS solution in the
Australian Aged Care industry. We work with over 1,200 Residential Aged Care
Homes in Australia, as well as hundreds of Home and Community Care, Disability
Support, and Retirement Living providers.

The MOA platform provides streamlined solutions for self-assessment against
the Aged Care Quality Standards, NDIS Practice Standards, and a range of other
frameworks; as well as supporting care providers in meeting obligations under
other programs such as the Serious Incident Response Scheme (SIRS) and the
National Aged Care Mandatory Quality Indicator Program (NACMQIP).

As of 2023, we're enabling exceptional care around the world, with
subsidiaries in New Zealand and the UK.

** About the Role **

You will work closely with the Director of Customer Success and Programs
Director, applying your knowledge of quality, compliance, and self-assessment
processes to ensure each client's MOA program is tailored to their specific
needs, and support providers in the ongoing management of their subscriptions.
This will involve tailoring MOA's own “off the shelf” self-assessment tools to
suit the varying needs of each provider; as well as working alongside
providers to configure their custom tools within the platform. You'll also
provide guidance on the use of other modules of the MOA platform including our
surveys, quality indicator tools, incident management system, plan for
continuous improvement, and extensive suite of benchmarked reports.

If you have a background in the aged care or disability support sectors and
are eager to transition into the healthcare software technology space, this
role offers an exciting opportunity.

** Responsibilities **

  * Ongoing management of clients' subscriptions within the MOA platform, both directly and in collaboration with the Customer Success team. 
  * Provide ‘second line’ support to users of MOA, handling more complex queries about the program. 
  * Provide training and support to users of MOA through structured training sessions, and on an ad-hoc basis. 
  * Collaborate with our content team to tailor their auditing, survey, and quality indicator tools to meet their specific needs. 
  * Assist clients in adapting their in-house tools for use in MOA. 
  * Guide clients in understanding and interpreting their reports. 
  * Provide regular feedback to the Product Development and Support teams to assist in continuous improvement of the MOA platform.
