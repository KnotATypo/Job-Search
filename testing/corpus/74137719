** AEMO at the Heart of Energy **

We are the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), committed to designing
and operating a sustainable energy system that delivers safe, reliable, and
affordable electricity and gas. Our mission includes facilitating the
transition to a net-zero energy system by 2050, working collaboratively with
industry partners to achieve 100% renewable generation capability by 2025. We
have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to co-design the future of our energy
systems, and our core values revolve around Character, Commitment, and
Connection. Join us as we contribute to this significant mission in the energy
sector.

** About the role **   
Sitting within the System Design division the Onboarding and Connections (O&C)
department is responsible for the end to end connection process across the
National Electricity Market (NEM). Operationally, it works closely with
transmission and distribution network service providers in supporting project
developers and equipment manufacturers through the application, registration,
and commissioning phases of the project lifecycle to enable release to full
operation.

Reporting into the Manager Connections Reform this new position will manage
and coordinate AEMO’s activities in relation to major connection reform
processes, with an initial focus on developing Renewable Energy Zones (REZs)
in Queensland, together with broader reforms covering integration of emerging
technologies or connections, integration of major network augmentations,
streamlining of connection processes, and implementation of regulatory
changes.

The position requires extensive stakeholder management and negotiation of
agreed approaches across a variety of conflicting interests. Key stakeholders
include Queensland Government, Powerlink (REZ delivery body), generation
developers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and industry associations
such as the Clean Energy Council (CEC). Consultation and collaboration
processes, and their design, will be key to the success of this role. It also
requires the coordination of activities and outcomes with other parts of AEMO
and industry partners to maximise the ability for this work to feed into other
AEMO and industry processes, e.g. Connections Reform Initiative (CRI), Access
Standards Review, NSW REZ, Engineering Framework.

This is an incredible opportunity to collaborate with government,
stakeholders, and industry, responding to evolving needs. As connection
volumes surge amid transition, there is increasing necessity to streamline
processes and you will play a pivotal role in managing this transformation
across the industry.

** What you will be doing **

In some workstreams, this will involve representing AEMO on industry working groups and coordinating with other workstreams to ensure an aligned outcome where these workstreams overlap. 
  2. Allocate and manage resources to lead and deliver substantive changes to support the integration of Queensland REZs. The support should be timely, consultative and respond to the sense of urgency expressed by industry or Government. 
  3. Develop stakeholder management plans for the delivery of these initiatives, and lead stakeholder negotiations across a diverse set of stakeholders with conflicting interests. 
  4. Lead any implementation of changes to internal AEMO and broader industry processes arising from these processes. 
  5. Build a service-oriented culture, based on client partnerships and close collaboration within AEMO and across industry. 
  6. Lead a step-change improvement in AEMO’s technical collaboration with clients and the energy industry, and analysis/reporting methods and tools, to ensure proactive identification of common industry challenges, constructive and outcome-focused problem solving, as well as robust, transparent decision making. 
  7. Prepare clear, concise, and high quality written and verbal communication to inform internal or external stakeholders on a range of issues for both technical and non-technical audiences 
  8. Proactively build AEMO’s reputation as a trusted partner to generation developers, original equipment manufacturers, Government, Network Service Providers, Market Participants, Customers, and other stakeholders.
