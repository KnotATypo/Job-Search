Software Engineers. With a range of different products, our client has an
impressive portfolio of their own clients and are expanding.

** The Role

Currently in the development team there are 5 other full stack developers and 2 testers which will now grow to 7 developers. **   
** The goal is to bring on 2 developers who are comfortable with the full Microsoft Stack and have commercial knowledge of mobile applications and APIs that are also at times ok with working with a slightly older stack for initial maintenance reasons.

  * Work in a close knit team and be a crucial part to the development practice and bring ideas to the group 
  * Write robust code using modern frameworks including .NET Core 
  * Help guide other team members when needed to complete projects in a timely manner. 
  * Participate and contribute to the design, architecture, development, and testing of the projects and write documentation. 

** Your Profile: **

  * Extensive experience working .NET, C# and SQL Server 
  * Experience working with APIs 
  * Working knowledge with Xamarin, .NET Maui or an alternative mobile framework would be an advantage 
  * Be confident in presenting your work to business stakeholders.
