** Senior Software Engineer – Video Processing: Shaping the future of video **

  
Clipchamp is the go-to video platform with one simple mission: to empower
anyone to tell stories worth sharing. Since 2016 we’ve attracted over 50
million registered users globally and counting, and that’s only the beginning.
We've now joined Microsoft's Office Product Group (OPG).  
Building and maintaining strong connections across location and time is
critical in the world we live in, and the emotional power of media – video,
audio, and photos – makes it perfect for fostering personal connections and
sharing information.  
Our in-browser platform and native Windows app gives users access to
professional video editing tools and features alongside a 1 million asset-
strong stock library and hundreds of editable video templates. We're the go-to
platform that's built with everyday editors and creators in mind.

** About the Team **   
While Clipchamp is predominantly based in Australia, OPG is a global team,
with offices in multiple countries. Joining Clipchamp means you'll join a team
of colleagues who live all around the world. We’re committed to each team
member feeling connected, regardless of where they work and live  
  
** Our Stack **   
Our stack is diverse and a combination of browser, Windows native, and iOS
applications. We push the limits of the browser and use it like an operating
system to perform complex video processing pipelines and editing workflows.
Our video editing and exporting is executed client-side, using tech like
TypeScript React, WebAssembly, FFmpeg, WASM and OpenGL, to name a few. We’re a
first class member in the Microsoft Office 365 organisation and our backend
runs on Microsoft technologies such as OneDrive, Sharepoint and Azure. The
video platform team designs, builds and maintains a cross-platform set of
video processing and rendering libraries which run across browser, iOS and
Windows native applications.

** Qualifications **

** Who we’re looking for: **

  * Passionate and opinionated about graphics rendering and composition of videos, 2D text rendering, audio manipulations, video encoding and decoding, etc 
  * The team writes code mostly in TypeScript/Javascript, a little bit of Rust and some C 
  * Technologies that are relevant to this position are (in order of relevance): React, WebAssembly, Babylon.js, Skia, FFmpeg, OpenGL, WebGL, WebGPU, WebCodecs, WebAudio, GPGPU, SIMD, audio programming and digital signal processing. We don’t expect you to be an expert in all of them, but knowledge of some will definitely help to make you feel at home in the team. 
  * As a senior we expect you to have demonstrated experience in software development and have a track record of collaboration in your own team and across squads – you can consider others’ ideas, implement new methods, surface and resolve disagreements and empathize with users without breaking a sweat. 

** Bonus points if you love: **

  * Online video and contributing to the technically challenging problems we’re solving 
  * Maxing out what browsers can do, that’s what we’re about! We were told you can’t build a video editing platform in browser, including encoding the final video – but we did 

Please note: All new employees of Clipchamp will be required to partake in a
background check.

** Responsibilities **

** As a Senior Software Engineer, you’ll be: **

  * Working in a team that focuses on the hard-core video processing capabilities, necessary to encode, decode, compose and render videos. 
  * Collaborating on technical decisions related to our in-browser and cross-platform video editing pipeline and improving the product performance and experience 
  * Leading the way in developing novel solutions for video encoding, decoding, and composition by leveraging open-source and internal libraries to support all aspects of the rendering pipeline, e.g. 2D text rendering, animations, audio-processing libraries 
  * Leveraging browser and native APIs to process high-resolution video and audio content in real-time and faster-than-real-time 
  * Measuring, monitoring and tracking key metrics across the video processing pipeline for all of Clipchamp’s customers 
  * Contributing to strategic decisions with other developers, designers, and product managers in small cross functional teams 
  * Advancing your career in a truly innovative environment
