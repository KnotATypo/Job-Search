** Who are we looking for? **

We are seeking a Lecturer in Mathematical Modelling to join School of
Mathematical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Academic Division.

We are seeking to appoint an applied mathematician or statistician with
research interests in mathematical biology or a closely related field. Other
candidates with a capacity to contribute to these fields or a strong track
record in computational or mathematical modelling are also encouraged to
apply. Suitable candidates may have demonstrated knowledge and experience in
applying mathematical modelling to real-world applications, particularly in
the areas of biology and medicine. The successful candidate will have an
interest and ability to provide high-quality learning experiences in
disciplines covered by the school: applied and computational mathematics,

** About us **

QUT is a major Australian university with a global outlook and a 'real world'
focus. We are an ambitious and collaborative institution that seeks to equip
our students and graduates with the skills they will need in an increasingly
disrupted and challenged world.

The School of Mathematical Sciences (SMS) is a vibrant, multidisciplinary
school with extensive teaching and research programs covering the fields of
statistics, operations research and applied and computational mathematics.
There are currently 29 full-time academic staff members employed in the
School, including 10 full Professors, an ARC Laureate Fellow and 2 ARC
Discovery Early Career Fellows. Over the past four years 5 staff members were
awarded an ARC Discovery Early Career Award, 4 staff were awarded ARC Future
Fellowships and 3 professors were in Australia’s top five most highly cited
researchers in mathematics in 2016, 2018, and 2019. The School also has two
recipients of national teaching excellence awards in mathematics. The School
offers programs of study at Bachelors, Honours, Masters (research) and PhD
levels. The Bachelor of Mathematics degree offers majors in our three key
areas of expertise, namely Statistics, Operations Research and Applied and
Computational Mathematics. The SMS hosts a node of the prestigious Australian
Research Council Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical
Frontiers: Big Data, Big Models, New Insights (ACEMS). The Centre includes
over 50 researchers and research students at QUT and almost 100 participants
across Australia. In November 2019, QUT officially opened the Centre for Data
Science which has a vision to be a national and global leader in the
development of frontier methods for the use of data to benefit our world. In
collaboration with government and industry, this Centre will draw together
capability in data science across Australia to solve global challenges across
all sectors. The Centre also has a strong remit in education to provide
rigorous training of current and future data scientists.
