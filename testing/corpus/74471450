##  About EcoCommons

The EcoCommons Australia platform is a culmination of a thirteen-year national
investment worth $8.45M across multiple partners, positioning the nation for
research with impact through effective leveraging of eco-data and eco-
analytics. EcoCommons currently provides access to over 60,000 curated
datasets—on species, environment and climate—and dynamically updated data-
streams through API with major national and international biodiversity data
providers. The Platform's existing capabilities span modelling geographic
distribution of single/multiple species (land, freshwater or oceans) and
species traits, based on environmental features and historical, current, or
projected future climates.

Software development will look to mature the existing Platform capabilities
and operation of EcoCommons Australia and continue alignment with ARDC’s
Planet Research Data Commons (Planet RDC) for biodiversity and ecological
modelling, specifically under the Modelling, Analytics and Decision Support
Infrastructure Program (MADSI).

##  About the Role

Technical delivery for development of scripts, packages and workflows needed
to complete key analytical tasks in ecological and biodiversity modelling
within the R programming language. The role is responsible for delivering
standardised, reproducible software tools, and supporting the integration of
those methods with the wider EcoCommons platform.

This is a hands-on role which requires technical expertise to tackle complex
technical challenges encountered by researchers and decision-makers concerned
with biodiversity including ecosystem services, biosecurity, natural resource
management and climate-related impacts and responses. The role strives to
continuously develop new and improved data engineering and operations
capabilities.

##  Key responsibilities

  * Develop scripts to deliver species distribution models and ensemble models in R. 
  * Work with other developers to link R scripts to workflows written in other programming languages (such as Python). 
  * Develop R packages to support reproducible workflows. 
  * Liaise with users and their communities/representatives regarding the delivery of data services to meet their requirements. 
  * Work collaboratively with colleagues within your team and across partner institutions to reach objectives. 
  * Understand user requirements and impacts on implementation, testing and delivery. 
  * Integrate knowledge and experience of software development, task planning, and available technical options, to assist improving processes. 
  * Assist collaborators to integrate their requirements into software products, including strategic advice regarding the impacts and potential of available technical solutions. 
  * Be aware of security considerations and implementation of security best practices. 
  * Iterative improvement of software and system architecture. 
  * Actively contribute to and identify opportunities for improved system performance through regular review of metadata, data, and quality assurance processes. 
  * Actively communicate with a geographically dispersed team to share knowledge, collaboratively use a range of software, document work, and solve problems. 
  * Interact and engage with external organisations to provide desired project outcomes. 
  * Take shared ownership of complex problems and issues to resolve them within the agreed timeframes. 
  * Report on progress against project tasks and milestones. 
  * Contribute to the development and delivery of training programs. 
  * Interface with stakeholders to manage expectations and ensure satisfaction. 
  * Work closely and actively communicate with a team of engineers, product managers, and analysts. 
  * Capture requirements and develop proposals with collaborators. 
  * Contribute to strategy for long term platform architecture. 
  * Be aware of security considerations and implementation of security best practices. 
  * Ensure awareness of and compliance with legislation and host university policies. 
  * Maintain high standards of professionalism and approach tasks in an ethical manner.
