Are you ready for the next big challenge in your career? At TechnologyOne, we
are redefining the future of the ERP software that our customers use to run
their organisations and ultimately deliver outcomes for the communities we
live within, and we need your help! We are looking for an experienced Cloud
Software Architect to help design, and work with development teams to build,
our next generation, cloud-native ERP platform.  
  
You will be working with cross-functional teams across our engineering
business to build the platform and to deliver exceptional services to your
internal customers. You will love the mix of being able to both
design/architect solutions, but then also be hands on - directly working on
development, testing, deployment and support of the platform. You will have
deep experience working in an agile environment and be comfortable with modern
software development approaches that support fast delivery of value to
customers and iterative feedback loops, including CI/CD deployments.  
  
We are looking for problem solvers, who are up for a challenge. You will be
forging new paths, leaning on the strengths of your teammates and writing the
playbook as you go. Our passion is to solve the complex, transforming business
and making life simple - by leveraging our team's innovation, drive and
determination.
