Just Digital People are currently working with a Brisbane-based, digital
agency who are expanding their team as their project work continues to grow
and grow.  
  
Reporting to the Head of Digital, you will work alongside a team who are
developing projects for a range of clients predominately in WordPress.  
  
You will need 3+ years commercial experience with WordPress (including custom
theme development), PHP & JavaScript.  
  
The perfect person for this role will be someone who loves to think outside
the box and is eager to re-think solutions and constantly make improvements so
the project is the best it can be. If you have previous experience working in
an agency environment this would be a big plus but not essential.  
  
This role is based in Brisbane CBD and does require two to three days a week
in the office.  
  
***   
  
If you would like to learn more about this role please apply or reach out to
me directly.
