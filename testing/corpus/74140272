** The world is full of wicked problems to solve. That’s why we need you **   
The challenge of finding vulnerabilities that no one else has found is what
gets you out of bed each morning.  
  
You’re at your best when using your skills to solve problems that tackle the
most critical challenges facing Australian enterprises and governments today.  
  
You bring your whole self to work, because checking your personality at the
door isn’t for you.

ATMs, medical devices, satellites, and various operational technology) and we
put our customers to the test with social engineering, red teaming, and

We celebrate our craft (think Hack of the Month), share our discoveries
(internal conferences where we share our research) and you’ve probably seen
our team at local meet ups and cons because we support and encourage them to
get involved.
