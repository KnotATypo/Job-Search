** Technical Lead (Node, Typescript, React + AWS) | Brisbane City + 3 days WFH **   
  
Utilise your technical expertise and leadership skills and play a pivotal role
in driving the success of this tech driven org's SaaS products.  
  
Alongside managing your 2-3 direct reports (co developers), you'll play a huge
role in the laying down of new architecture; establishing new tech patterns
within the team and getting stuck into product development.  
  
For example, if there's a new product or a new part of an application, you'll
be first one in there doing foundational development or re-architecting
something that needs an up-lift and then distributing that work to your peers.  
  
If this sounds like a role that you'd be interested in getting into and you
tick the boxes below:  

  * 8+ years of commercial experience in software development, with a focus on web apps; 
  * Technical expertise across the JS stack; specifically Node.js with TS and React.js; 
  * Experience working with AWS services to architect scalable and reliable cloud-based solutions; 
  * Solid understanding of relational and NoSQL databases, RESTful APIs, and microservices architecture. 
  * Excellent communication and leadership skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with cross-functional teams including product managers, designers and developers. 
Please don't hesitate to apply for immediate consideration.  
  
Alternatively, if this isn’t the right opportunity for you but you’re
interested in other opportunities within the Software Engineering industry in
Brisbane, feel free to contact me.
