  * It’s important that you are keen to learn, are able to work independently in the field, and have an eye for detail, data capture and management. 
  * We’d like you to be a good communicator, and have the ability to get along with other people.

  * The role requires you to travel to sites to undertake the monitoring. We’ll need you to have a current full "C class" driver’s license so that you can operate our vehicles.
