Hi there,

  
I'm the CEO and Founder of Elepay. My name is Gino De Pasquale. Thanks for
taking the time to review this position and consider your fit.

Our growing online financial services business requires another special person
to join our team. We are looking for a person who mirrors the existing culture
of the Elepay business:  
  
** Agile **   
** Innovative **   
** Efficient **   
** Multi-Disciplined **   
** Customer Centric **   
** Lots of Fun and Energetic **   
  
The specific skill set we are looking for can be described as:

** Wix Design Skills : **   
You have at least 2 years relevant experience already designing on WIX so you
can hit the road running. NO training, just jump straight in. You are also
aware of the new Wix design studio capabilities, and are ready to embrace the
every evolving world of “change”. (please DO NOT apply if you have zero or
limited WIX skills – you won’t be shortlisted sorry )  
  
** Creative Skills: **   
We are looking for a fast paced well established creative mind as well. You
have great UX skills and can add lots of value as we look to create digital
products that provide meaningful and relevant digital experiences that focus
on improving the usability, accessibility and interaction of our services.

** Working Environment: **   
We operate from a large modern office in Hamilton, Brisbane Northside. It's a
beautifully appointed large space in a well-maintained corporate park.
Commuting to the office is easy - but I don't expect you to make the effort if
you live further than a 30-minute one-way journey each day. Travel can become
onerous. This is something that I will review very strictly when reviewing all
candidates.

** Working Hours: **   
Elepay is all about collaboration and team support. So we expect all our team
members to make themselves available every working day between 8 am and 5 pm
in the office where the business is the only priority.
