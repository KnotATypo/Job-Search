##  ** Acknowledgement **

Aurecon acknowledges Indigenous Australians as the Traditional Owners of the
lands, waters and communities on which it operates. We acknowledge the
national importance of the continuation of cultural, spiritual and educational
practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, for all
Australians.

We pay our respects to Elders past and present, and to all Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Aurecon employees, and peoples across the many
communities in which we live, visit and work.

##  ** Aurecon’s vision is for a reconciled Australia **

Aurecon’s vision is for a reconciled Australia, where Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander peoples are respected, their success celebrated, cultures
fully valued, and where social and economic opportunities between Indigenous
and non-Indigenous Australians are equal. Aurecon drives progress of a
reconciled Australia through the Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP).

With the support of our RAP Leadership Team, Indigenous Australian Employee
Network (as advisors) and RAP Working Group, we continue to identify where we
can make the most meaningful contribution towards reconciliation within our
communities and within Australia.
