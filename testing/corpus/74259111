We have a great opportunity for a Mid Level Developer who has a love for
backend development.  
  
For this role, we are looking for someone with at least 3 years commercial
experience, ideally focussed in the backend. If you have a background working
in a large scale company this would be a big plus as we are looking for
developers who have experience building complex web applications for both
desktop and mobile.  
  
You'll need prior experience with:  

  * Development and deployment of backend microservices and APIs using .Net Core, C# and Terraform. 
  * Azure Cloud components. 
  * Software testing. 
  * Working within Agile environments. 
  
If you are looking for a place where you can genuinely be appreciated for your
quality of work alongside a laid back and supportive team, then this is the
company for you! They have a very social team as well and have a number of fun
events you can attend through the year and an on-site gym!  
  
This company is also well known for providing their developers with internal
development opportunities as well.  
  
If you'd like to learn more about this opportunity please apply below or reach
out directly!
