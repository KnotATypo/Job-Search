** Your opportunity: Forensic Technology **

Applications are now open to join our Forensic Technology teams for the 2025
Graduate Program intake.

Our forensic technology services encompass data capture and collection,
digital information analysis and eDiscovery. Using cutting edge technology and
rigorous forensic processes, we uncover, analyse and clarify the facts by
blending and visualising data sets, driving commercially focused decision
making.

This is your opportunity to work alongside our experts on some of the highest-
profile matters across the Asia-Pacific region. Experience expert mentoring
and assist as we advise clients on best practices at the onset of an
investigation and employ efficient procedures to gather information in a
manner that avoids spoilation, uncovers responsive data and preserves relevant
evidence. Make a real impact as, together, we help clients mitigate risk,
understand what happened, secure evidence and support internal, legal,
regulatory and law enforcement enquiries.

We have opportunities across our various offices, so please indicate from the
listed options which city you are interested in.

** What you’ll be doing **

As a graduate in our forensic technology group, you'll be part of a diverse
team and will learn the specialist skills and methodologies to become an
expert in digital forensic and forensic discovery. While no two days will be
the same, you can expect to:

  * work in a high tech forensic laboratory using cutting-edge equipment 
  * conduct forensic imaging of computers and other electronic devices (e.g. flash media, smartphones) to find and secure evidence 
  * conduct digital aspects of investigations alongside our expert investigators 
  * research new opportunities and assist with the preparation of proposals 
  * attend training courses to keep up to date with industry leading software 
  * attend events and other marketing activities 

But it’s not all about work. You’ll be given a buddy to help you navigate
office life as you settle in. You’ll choose a mentor who will help guide your
career. We host regular events and activities, bringing together our close-
knit team in a friendly and relaxed environment so you can get to know the
people behind the professionals. You’ll also become a member of Accelerate,
our young professionals networking group.

You can also make a positive difference in your community through regular
charity and industry events. Whether it’s volunteering at local food rescue
venues or participating in a stair challenge or bike rides to raise money for
children’s charities, you can get involved and give back.

** About you **

You will be a recent graduate or student in your final year of study and will
have:

  * an IT, computer science or law degree with strong academic results. 
  * excellent analytical and technical skills, with an ability to think outside-the-box. 
  * strong written skills. 
  * great communication skills and enjoy working in a team. 
  * eligibility to live and work in Australia.
