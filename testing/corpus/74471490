##  ** About Voconiq **

Voconiq is a mission-based, data-driven startup providing a voice to
communities in the companies, industries and institutions that influence their
lives. The organisations we work with want to have meaningful relationships
with the communities they operate around – not just listening, but actively
engaging and working with these communities to create mutually beneficial
outcomes. Voconiq has developed a sophisticated data analytic engine that
enables this by translating community survey data into customer (and
community) insights. We are creating positive change through science and bring
the ‘Social’ to the measurement of ESG performance.

We are currently working in 11 countries on five continents, providing a range
of challenging and engaging contexts to navigate in delivering our services.
At times, these are contested spaces where our data helps to find constructive
ways for companies and communities to move forward – other times, we work with
industries to help create their first set of sustainability goals. In all our
work, what we do matters and has impact.

Our customers are diverse, including large renewable energy companies, mining
companies, local government bodies, and agricultural industries. What they
have in common is a desire to bring community voices into their decision
making.

What drives us each day is knowing we’re helping communities translate their
experiences, concerns and aspirations into a language our customers can
understand and then use to maximise their positive impact. And we’re growing
fast, with big plans for the next few years.

Just like the communities we serve, we’re a diverse team and on the hunt for
people with fresh insight, new ways of working— and the same passion we
have—to make an impact on a local and global scale. We have people based in
Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Sao Paulo, Harare and more.
