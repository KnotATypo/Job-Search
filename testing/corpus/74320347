** Northrop Consulting Engineers is more than just a workplace... **   

We’re inclusive. We’re diverse. We want everyone who joins us to fulfil their
potential, and we help, coax and sometimes push each other to achieve exactly
that.

We’ve got each other’s backs, and everyone is comfortable and happy being
themselves. Northrop is a home for high performers, but there’s no pretense
and little politics. We engage with each other and do great work together.

The business is owned by our senior people, who work among us and set the tone
for our open and nurturing culture.

Being employee owned means we decide what is important, which markets to work
in, who to work with, what opportunities to harness, and which risks to take.

It’s all on us. When we succeed, we benefit – not some investor sitting on a
beach. We’ve got skin in the game and we care deeply.
