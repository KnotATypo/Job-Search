** Company Description **

** About us **

Griffith University’s Centre for Quantum Dynamics (CQD) undertakes world-
leading research in quantum science and technology.

The Centre comprises more than 40 researchers—including theorists and
experimentalists—with strong collaborations. Our cutting-edge research
encompasses many areas, including quantum information processing, quantum
foundations, ultrafast quantum processes, and quantum biophysics. The Centre
hosts a node of the Australian Research Council’s Centre for Quantum
Computation and Communication Technology and is also home to the Australian
Attosecond Science Facility, the only laboratory in Australia where atoms,
molecules and materials can be probed on sub-femtosecond timescales.

** Job Description **

We are currently looking for a PhD candidate to work in quantum information
theory. The primary focus of this role is to contribute to an externally
funded project about photonic quantum state generation and quantum non-
locality.

This project includes analytic theory, coding, and simulations in quantum
optics and quantum information. Success in this role requires collaboration
with an immediate team consisting of Dr Travis Baker, Dr Nora Tischler, and
Prof Howard Wiseman; further collaborations are also likely with an extended
network of physicists in Australia and across the world.

As part of this project, there will be opportunities to travel to conferences,
and to undertake a research stay in the USA.

** Qualifications **

The selection of applicants for the award of higher degree research
scholarships at Griffith University involves consideration of your academic
merit and research background. To be successful within this role, you will be
able to understand and work through complex mathematical/physics problems,
have familiarity or interest in numerical programming techniques (e.g. Matlab,
Python, or similar), apply independent problem-solving, and communicate
scientific results clearly. You will have evidence of a passion for quantum
science, with a strong desire to undertake research in optical quantum
information theory.
