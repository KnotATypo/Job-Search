Bravus is a diversified group of Australian businesses delivering integrated
energy and infrastructure services for the future. We walk the talk on the
energy transition by helping to provide a sustainable and affordable global
energy mix.

We produce high-quality thermal coal for export at the Carmichael mine and
renewable energy from the Rugby Run solar farm, both in central Queensland.
Our Bowen Rail Company, Abbot Point Operations and North Queensland Export
Terminal businesses transport high quality coal from Queensland’s Bowen and
Galilee basins to the world.

These operations provide reliable and affordable energy solutions that help
reduce poverty in the Asia Pacific region and power growth. We are proud to
provide secure jobs and opportunities for businesses in regional Queensland,
and to help to support local economies so towns, cities and their residents
can thrive.

We are part of the global Adani Group. Together, our operations are
progressing the global transition to a lower emissions future – and fast. The
Adani Group is the world’s largest multinational solar energy company and a
pioneer in emerging renewables technologies via Adani New Industries Limited,
in areas such as green hydrogen.
