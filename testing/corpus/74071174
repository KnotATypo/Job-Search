** Senior Software Engineer - Data Engineer **   

Clipchamp is the go-to video platform with one simple mission: to empower
anyone to tell stories worth sharing. Since 2016 we’ve attracted over 50
million registered users globally and counting, and that’s only the beginning.
We've now joined Microsoft's Office Product Group (OPG)  
  
Building and maintaining strong connections across location and time is
critical in the world we live in, and the emotional power of media – video,
audio, and photos – makes it perfect for fostering personal connections and
sharing information.  
  
Our in-browser platform and native Windows app gives users access to
professional video editing tools and features alongside a 1 million asset-
strong stock library and hundreds of editable video templates. We're the go-to
platform that's built with everyday editors and creators in mind.  
  
** About the Team **   
  
While Clipchamp is predominantly based in Australia, OPG is a global team,
with offices in multiple countries. Joining Clipchamp means you'll join a team
of colleagues who live all around the world. We’re committed to each team
member feeling connected, regardless of where they work and live.  
  
** Clipchamp’s Technical Stack **   
  
As part of Microsoft, we use tools such as Azure Data Explorer (aka Kusto),
Cosmos, Scuba and Power BI. We also heavily use product metrics captured by
Amplitude.  
  
Our video editing experience lives completely in-browser, which means pushing
the boundaries of what web technologies can do. We hold a high bar for
performance and user experience and invest in unique technologies like in-
browser file caching, video composition, and video encoders.  
  
Our frontend codebase is built on React, TypeScript, WebAssembly,
ServiceWorkers, and WebGL. On the backend we use Python and are introducing C#
for native apps and services. We deploy code to production daily, supported by
a culture of automated testing and our dedicated engineering productivity
team.

** Responsibilities **

** As a Data Engineer you will be: **

  * Building and improving the data infrastructure and processes necessary to empower a diverse team of engineers, product managers, designers and growth specialists to derive value from data reliably and efficiently. 
  * Designing metrics and frameworks that will be used to drive decisions across the Clipchamp business. 
  * Working closely with product engineers to uplift Clipchamp’s data capabilities and drive non-functional outcomes. 
  * A driving force in Clipchamp’s privacy and GDPR compliance initiatives. 
  * Accelerating your career in a truly innovative and global engineering team.   

** Qualifications **

** Who we’re looking for: **

  * 5+ years demonstrated experience in a data engineering role, building ETL pipelines and transforming datasets for consumption by a wide audience of roles. 
  * Experience with Azure data tooling would be a plus 
  * Proficiency in a big data querying language such as SQL or Spark. 
  * A strong collaborator with a demonstrated ability to teach technical concepts and uplift organisational capabilities 
  * Passion for learning new skills with the ability to thrive in a feedback-driven environment. 
  * Someone who drives collaboration in your own team and across squads - you're able to consider others ideas, implement new methods, surface and resolve disagreements and empathize with users without breaking a sweat. 

  
** Bonus points if you love: **

  * Online video and contributing to the technically challenging problems we’re solving 
  * Maxing out what browsers can do, that’s what we’re about! We were told you can’t build a video editing platform in browser, including encoding the final video – but we did!

background check.
