Program come up, so please apply to still be in with a chance to start
something big with us!

** Why choose Engineering areas as a grad? **

Smooth-running infrastructure projects are good for business and good for the
community – you can be part of delivering some of Australia’s biggest and
best. Engineering graduates help clients plan, deliver, track and maintain
large-scale infrastructure projects, from sports stadiums to railways, often
working as part of cross-functional teams. If you’re good at seeing both the
big picture of a project’s aim as well as the smaller moving parts, use your
degree to start something big with us.

** Choose your pathway **

Everyone’s career is different, and we support unique growth and pathways.
With a range of disciplines and specialities, you can start in one place and
go almost anywhere as you build your career here.

Apply to this Technology, Digital and Engineering pathway and you’ll have the
option to select the stream of work you’re interested in. Not sure or open to
something new? No preference means we’ll match you where your degree and
interests fit.

** Location of this job: ** nominate your KPMG office location during the application process. 

** What is being a consultant? **

You’ll be part of a team of experienced and early-career professionals who
work on solving problems. The client (they could be an international company,
a local charity, a small business) brings us a challenge and we create a team
and a plan to help solve it. That team will be made up of colleagues from
several disciplines and backgrounds so we bring the best ideas to the table –
there might be civil engineers working alongside an environmental specialist
and change and communications professionals.

The work depends on the client and the problem you’re helping them solve. You
might be researching and gathering information, like how have we helped
another client with a similar challenge and how new technologies could help,
updating project plans, developing a maintenance schedule or coordinating a
project management office.

** About the graduate program **

• For students in their final year of study in 2024 or recently graduated and
not yet in professional work

• A one year grow pathway with targeted coaching, support and development as
you grow your new career

• Real work from the start so you can make an impact and learn straightaway
