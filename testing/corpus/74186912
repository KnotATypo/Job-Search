About UQ  
  
** As part of the UQ community, you'll have the opportunity to work alongside the brightest minds, who have joined us from all over the world, and within an environment where interdisciplinary collaborations are encouraged.   
  
At the core of our teaching remains our students, and their experience with us
sets a foundation for success far beyond graduation. UQ has made a [
commitment ](https://about.uq.edu.au/uq-initiatives/initiative/queensland-
commitment) to making education opportunities available for all Queenslanders,
regardless of personal, financial, or geographical barriers.  
  
As part of our commitment to excellence in research and professional practice
in academic contexts, we are proud to provide our staff with access to world-
class facilities and equipment, grant writing support, greater research
funding opportunities, and other forms of staff support and development.  
  
** About This Opportunity   
  
** The grains industry has a gross value of > $30 billion per year produced from sowing 25 M ha of crops and is a major export industry for Australia. The Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) uses grower levies to fund more than 800 research, development and extension (RD&E) investments worth $177 million (2022-23). UQ co-invests in grains research including via a new initiative, Analytics for the Australian Grains Industry (AAGI) which involves researchers and students from the Schools of Agriculture and Food Sustainability, Maths and Physics, and Electronic Engineering and Computer Science as well as from QAAFI (Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation - co-funded by the Queensland Government).   
  
AAGI is a five-year strategic partnership across UQ, Curtin University, and
the University of Adelaide that is aimed at harnessing analytics to drive the
sector's profitability and global impact. AAGI gives Australian growers an
opportunity to be world leaders in analytics-driven decision making to drive
efficiency and precision and support farm enterprise risk management. AAGI at
UQ provides an exciting environment for researchers to focus their efforts on
developing their expertise and emerging research profile in their discipline.  
  
This is a fixed-term position for up to 3 years. This postdoctoral fellowship
position based in the School of Agriculture and Food Sustainability will play
a lead role in developing statistical methods related to the analysis of field
crop trials. It will have a particular focus on applications of mixed models
