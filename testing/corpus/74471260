##  About the Role

Technical delivery for designing, building, and maintaining optimised and
highly available data infrastructure, pipelines, and workflows that facilitate
data management, data analytics, and modelling solutions. The role plans,
designs, develops, deploys, and administers frameworks and architectural
approaches that scale to handle user demands.

This is a hands-on role which requires technical expertise to deliver data and
analytical services including data ingestion, transformation, storage,
dashboarding, and model execution. The role strives to continuously develop
new and improved data engineering and operations capabilities.

The incumbent may exclusively support major projects or programs such as
EcoCommons Australia.

##  About EcoCommons

The EcoCommons Australia platform is a culmination of a thirteen-year national
investment worth $8.45M across multiple partners, positioning the nation for
research with impact through effective leveraging of eco-data and eco-
analytics. EcoCommons currently provides access to over 60,000 curated
datasets—on species, environment and climate—and dynamically updated data-
streams through API with major national and international biodiversity data
providers. The Platform's existing capabilities span modelling geographic
distribution of single/multiple species (land, freshwater or oceans) and
species traits, based on environmental features and historical, current, or
projected future climates.

Software development will look to mature the existing Platform capabilities
and operation of EcoCommons Australia and continue alignment with ARDC’s
Planet Research Data Commons (Planet RDC) for biodiversity and ecological
modelling, specifically under the Modelling, Analytics and Decision Support
Infrastructure Program (MADSI).
