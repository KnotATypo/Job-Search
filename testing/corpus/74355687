We have a unique opportunity for an ambitious and creative individual who
wants to be part of the development of a new series of innovative digital
products.

If you enjoy the early stages of new product development — where you'll be
shaping its future and strategic direction while also obsessing over crucial
details — then this opportunity could be exactly what you're looking for.

** This is not your typical product development role! **

You'll work as part of a small, highly focussed product team dedicated to
excellence and delivering experiences that delight users and surpass their
expectations. Results and outcomes are what matters most to this team and the
flexibility exists to experiment with novel ideas and course-correct where
necessary.

If you consider the following traits as part of your DNA we'd be keen to meet
you:

  * You enjoy working with new technologies that are not yet mainstream. 
  * You're a lifelong learner.Whether it be new tools and technologies, new concepts, new ways of working, new subjects & topics, you're passionate about expanding your knowledge and skillset. 
  * You love to experiment and are not at all afraid of, or intimidated by "failure". You're a critical thinker. You seek to understand the cause behind the effect, the underlying problem behind the symptoms and are excellent at asking the right questions to discover these answers. 
  * You have an analytical mindset. You have the ability to translate high-level ideas, concepts and requirements and break them down into smaller components and translate them into a workable solution. 
  * You love the big picture as much as the countless details that make it a reality. You're passionate about solving problems. 
  * You're flexible.You seamlessly adapt to short-term changes but remain committed to the broader vision. 

** What you'll be doing **

  * Capturing and translating requirements into digital solutions that will form part of a new ecosystem of products. 
  * Building those digital solutions using a new development platform we'll train you on. Quality assurance and functional testing of all new product releases. 
  * Resolving defects that are identified during quality assurance and production. Partaking in ideation workshops and advising on the technical viability of new concepts. 
  * Advising on solution architecture considerations particularly with regards to the development platform(s) you'll be working with. 
  * Working alongside third-party vendors and other internal product developers who are involved with related products within the ecosystem. 
  * Raising technical risks and issues and devising their mitigation plans. 

Over time, this role is expected to expand in its scope and there will be
opportunities to develop your leadership capabilities. We're keen to welcome
the successful candidate to our team as soon as possible so if this
opportunity resonates and is of interest to you, please send through your
resume to Paul Morris and we'll be in touch.
