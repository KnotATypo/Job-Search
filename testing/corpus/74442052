##  ** Overview **

** Product Designer - Clipchamp **   
  
Clipchamp is the go-to video platform with one simple mission: to empower
anyone to tell stories worth sharing. Since 2016 we’ve attracted over 50
million registered users globally and counting, and that’s only the beginning.
We've now joined Microsoft's Office Product Group (OPG)  
  
Building and maintaining strong connections across location and time is
critical in the world we live in, and the emotional power of media – video,
audio, and photos – makes it perfect for fostering personal connections and
sharing information.  
  
Our in-browser platform and native Windows app gives users access to
professional video editing tools and features alongside a 1 million asset-
strong stock library and hundreds of editable video templates. We're the go-to
platform that's built with everyday editors and creators in mind.  
  
** About the Team **   
  
While Clipchamp is predominantly based in Australia, OPG is a global team,
with offices in multiple countries. Joining Clipchamp means you'll join a team
of colleagues who live all around the world. We’re committed to each team
member feeling connected, regardless of where they work and live.  
  
** About the Squad **   
  
You’ll be joining a squad who work on designing, developing, and implementing
AI-based technologies to create innovative and advanced features to enhance
Clipchamp’s user experience.

** About the Role **   
  
We're transforming the way people tell stories through video, by giving our
users a powerfully simple video creation experience.  

We're looking for someone who has a keen interest in the video space and is
excited to help us push the boundaries of what's possible with Clipchamp. As a
systems-thinker grounded in empathy, you're driven to provide world class
experiences by uncovering user needs and working with your team to make video
creation with Clipchamp friction-free and delightful.  
  
As a global employer of thousands of designers, Microsoft provides endless
opportunities for learning. Along with access to valuable resources like
LinkedIn learning, and mentorship programs, Microsoft is uniquely positioned
to support your career growth.
