  
  
At BHP, our purpose is to bring people and resources together to build a
better world, and we would like to offer you the opportunity to gain exposure
to the resources sector at an early stage of your career. Why not you?

  
  

** We offer our Interns the opportunity to: **

  * Do paid work in diverse teams who will support, encourage, and help you build your technical skills for the future. 
  * Build your own professional network with a range of technical experts and graduates. 
  * Attend networking events with other interns and graduates. 
  * If your role is based on a mine site we cover your flights, accommodation, PPE clothing and meals.

About the Role **

As BHP Intern, you will be able to apply all you've learnt in real world
situations and use your initiative to seek out projects to showcase your
capability.

As a successful intern you'll get first access to our Australian Graduate
Program opportunities or be invited back for another internship if you are in
the earlier years of your degree.

Opportunities are available in Western Australia, Queensland and South
Australia.

  
** What we are looking for **

We are looking for people just like you to help produce essential resources
for the energy transition, development of infrastructure, and a better world -
both now and in the future.

You'll be a student who is between their second to penultimate year and is
able to work with us for 10-12 weeks over the summer break.

You will be passionate about making a difference and the desire to learn more
about the skills required to drive innovation and deliver outcomes as part of
a team.

  
Your degree could be from one of the following (but not limited) to:

  * Engineering: Mining, Mechanical, Mechatronics, Electrical, Mine Geotechnical, Civil, Structural, Metallurgy / Minerals Processing, Chemical, Construction Management, Project Management, Instrumentation Control and Automation 
  * Science: Earth Science / Geology, Hydrogeology, Environmental, Physics, Chemistry, Spatial Science (Surveying), GIS 
  * Health Science: Safety, Health 
  * Technology: Computer Science, Data Science, Cybersecurity, Maths and Statistics 
  * Business: Commerce. Finance, Accounting 

  
As our Intern opportunities for engineering and science are residentially
based near our mining operations or will require you to work on a Fly-In-Fly-
Out (FIFO) roster, it is important that you'll be willing to consider either
of these arrangements to undertake an Intern role. Roles such as Technology
and Finance will support our operations from our city locations, but they are
never far from the action.

International students who have a valid visa with no work restrictions for the
duration of the internship program are eligible to apply.  
  
**   
Please note applications will close on 8th April 2024.
