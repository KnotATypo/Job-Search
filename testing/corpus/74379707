##  ** About UQ **

As part of the UQ community, you'll have the opportunity to work alongside the
brightest minds, who have joined us from all over the world, and within an
environment where interdisciplinary collaborations are encouraged.  
  
As part of our commitment to research excellence, we are proud to provide our
staff with access to world-class facilities and equipment, grant writing
support, greater research funding opportunities, and post-fellowship contracts
via our [ UQ Amplify initiative ](https://www.uq.edu.au/research/research-
support/research-management/funding-schemes/uq-internal-initiatives/uq-
amplify) .  
  
At the core of our teaching remains our students, and their experience with us
sets a foundation for success far beyond graduation. Not only do we have one
of the largest PhD enrolments in Australia, but we have also made a [
commitment ](https://about.uq.edu.au/uq-initiatives/initiative/queensland-
commitment) to making education opportunities available for all Queenslanders,
regardless of personal, financial, or geographical barriers.

##  ** About This Opportunity **

The grains industry has a gross value of > $30 billion per year produced from
sowing 25 M ha of crops and is a major export industry for Australia. The
Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) uses grower levies to fund
more than 800 research, development and extension (RD&E) investments worth
$177 million (2022-23). UQ co-invests in grains research including via a new
initiative, Analytics for the Australian Grains Industry (AAGI) which involves
researchers and students from the Schools of Agriculture and Food
Sustainability, Maths and Physics, and Electronic Engineering and Computer
Science as well as from QAAFI (Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food
Innovation - co-funded by the Queensland Government).  
  
AAGI is a five-year strategic partnership across UQ, Curtin University, and
the University of Adelaide that is aimed at harnessing analytics to drive the
sector's profitability and global impact. AAGI gives Australian growers an
opportunity to be world leaders in analytics-driven decision making to drive
efficiency and precision and support farm enterprise risk management. AAGI at
UQ provides an exciting environment for researchers to focus their efforts on
developing their expertise and emerging research profile in their discipline.  
  
This is a fixed-term position for up to 3 years. This postdoctoral fellowship
position based in the School of Mathematics and Physics will play a lead role
in developing crop trait prediction solutions based on physics informed
machine learning to allow accurate predictions by combining physical knowledge
and data. Methods will include use of deterministic crop models to generate
training data for PIML, and testing against observed datasets. In addition to
AAGI, this position will service research needs of other UQ and GRDC supported
projects.  
  
Key responsibilities will include:

  * Produce quality research outputs consistent with discipline norms by publishing or exhibiting in high quality fora. 
  * Work collaboratively with AAGI, UQ and grains industry colleagues to deliver research, analytical support and teaching activities 
  * Provide analytical support for research projects supported by AAGI and which are aligned with the expertise of the applicant 
  * Contribute to transfer of knowledge, technology and practices to colleagues and to researchers within the Australian grains industry 
  * Review and draw upon best practice research methodologies 
  * Contribute to the effective supervision of Honours and Higher Degree by Research students 
  * On an as-needs basis: 
    * Provide feedback, coaching, and professional development to others in the research teams, including to Service and Support of AAGI investments 
    * Manage research support staff effectively throughout the employee lifecycle in accordance with University policy and procedures 
    * Work to promptly resolve conflict and grievances when they arise, in accordance with University policy and procedures. 
  * Demonstrate citizenship and leadership behaviours that align to the UQ values. 
  * Provide support to other academic positions and unit operations as needed during other team members absences. 
  * Contribute to internal service roles and administrative processes as required, including participation in decision-making and service on relevant committees. 
  * Collaborate in service activities external to the immediate organisation unit. 
  * Develop external links and partnerships by cultivating relationships with the grains industry, government departments, professional bodies and the wider community.
