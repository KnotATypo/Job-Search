About the Role  
**   
Our award-winning, industry-leading graduate program is looking for graduates
who will challenge us, as we will challenge them. You'll complete structured
course work, learn on-the-job, rotate into different teams, and contribute to
business and technical projects.  
  
As a BHP Graduate, your 24-month program is a balanced approach to building
your technical and professional capabilities through a structured program.
When you start, you'll be given a buddy who will show you the ropes and gain
access to our mentor program to help shape your career.

Opportunities are available in Western Australia, Queensland and South
Australia.  
  
As BHP Graduate, you will:

  * Rotate into different teams 2-4 times 
  * Work alongside industry leaders 
  * Collaborate on projects across multiple disciplines 
  * Contribute to improvement initiatives 
  * Attend technical forums where you will hear inspiring presentations, participate in activities focused on expanding your technical knowledge and networking with other graduates. 

  
** What we are looking for: **

We are looking for people just like you to help produce essential resources
for the energy transition, development of infrastructure, and a better world -
both now and in the future.  
  
You will have already graduated in 2022 or 2023 or be eligible for graduation
by the end of 2024. Your degree could be from one of the following (but not
limited) to:

  * Engineering: Mining, Mechanical, Mechatronics, Electrical, Mine Geotechnical, Civil, Metallurgy / Minerals Processing, Chemical, Construction Management, Instrumentation Control and Automation, Structural, Quantity Surveying 
  * Science: Earth Science / Geology, Hydrogeology, Environmental, Chemistry, Spatial Science (Surveying), GIS 
  * Health Science: Safety, Health, Nursing, Paramedical Science 
  * Technology: Computer Science, Data Science, Cybersecurity, Maths and Statistics 
  * Business: Commerce. Finance, Accounting, Law, Economics   

As our graduate opportunities for engineering and science are residentially
based near our mining operations or require you to work on a Fly-In-Fly-Out
(FIFO) roster, it is important that you'll be willing to consider either of
these arrangements to undertake a grad role. Roles such as Technology and
Commercial will support our operations from our city locations, but they are
never far from the action.  

International students who have a valid visa with no work restrictions are
eligible to apply.  
  
**   
Please note applications will close on 8th April 2024.
