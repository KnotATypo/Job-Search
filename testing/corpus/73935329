** The Opportunity **

APNIC is the Regional Internet Registry for the Asia Pacific Region. We're an
open, independent, not-for-profit membership organization responsible for
distributing and managing Internet number resources (IP addresses and AS
numbers) within the Asia Pacific region's 56 economies.

We are seeking a customer service guru to join our Member & Registry team and
play a key role in reviewing applications for Internet number resources and
delegating them to our Members, according to policies developed by the
community. In addition to performing this critical service, you'll proactively
engage with Members to support their usage of other APNIC products and
services via chat, email and phone calls to maximize the value of their
membership.

The role forms part of our South East Asia Member & Registry team who pride
themselves on their multicultural, respectful and service orientated culture.
On a day-to-day basis you'll get the opportunity to:

  * Support and guide a potential member through the membership application process 
  * Maintain the integrity of the Registry through the accurate delegation of IP address blocks according to policies 
  * Maintain the accuracy of the Whois Database, our public facing database that facilitates the smooth running of the Internet 
  * Provide SME services to our product teams to help them develop value add products 
  * Engage with Members to increase awareness of our other value add products and services and support their usage to maximize the value of their membership 

Due to the sub regional focus of the role you will be required to work on a
rotating roster. The shift times are 9am-5.30pm and 12.30pm-9pm and we will
try to accommodate your needs where possible regarding shifts.

The recruitment process will include two rounds of interviews, a practical and
pre-employment checks (reference, work rights and police checks). The first
round of interviews for the role will commence from early March 2024.

** Who are we and what do we do? **

As the Regional Internet Registry for the Asia Pacific, we work for the good
of the Internet and the 4.7 billion people who use it across the globe.

We're an open, member-based Not-For-Profit and are responsible for
distributing and managing Internet number resources (IP addresses and AS
numbers) in 56 economies. These number resources are the building blocks for
the Internet to operate and grow.

We also provide dedicated ongoing support to our near 10,000 members across
the Asia Pacific, and are invested in building essential technical skills in
our region. We deliver training and technical assistance in multiple formats.
We also develop and support open forums for Internet policy development,
produce insightful research, and offer grants and fellowships.

** Why is this so important? **

The people who created the Internet decided right from the start that it
should be a public resource that is managed and shared in a fair way. Today,
that's more important - and more challenging - than ever before.

Every day, we work to make it happen.

  * By managing fair access to IP addresses… 
  * By delivering support and guidance to those who are using them… 
  * By leading and supporting open research, discussion and development across the globe… 

We enable and promote an Internet that is a global, open, stable and secure
for all.
