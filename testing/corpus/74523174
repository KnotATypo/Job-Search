** Cross River Rail Delivery Authority (CRRDA)…Your chance to work with the best! **

Cross River Rail will transform the way we travel to, from and through
Brisbane in the future. It will be a catalyst for 10 years of wider rail
transformation across the whole of South East Queensland and it is already
playing a key role in how we prepare for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic
Games.

Cross River Rail is a new 10.2km rail line including 5.9km of twin tunnels
running under the Brisbane River and CBD. It includes the delivery of four new
underground stations, two new above-ground stations, accessibility rebuilds
for six stations, the construction of three new stations on the Gold Coast,
and the introduction of a new world-class ‘ETCS' signalling system.

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to work on one of Australia's largest
infrastructure projects and to be a part of something that will leave a legacy
for generations to come.
