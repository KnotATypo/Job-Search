** The Role **

We will strongly invest in your career by supplying you with rewarding
opportunities, flexible working arrangements, comprehensive internal and
external training, and a competitive employment package designed for skilled
employees.

TTV Branch is seeking Cyber Threat Hunt Analysts that can analyses network and
host activity to identify anomalous behaviour.

Successful applicants will hunt sophisticated actors subverting common EDR
detection and mitigation techniques through developing and implementing
innovative detection capabilities and analytical tradecraft, furthering the
ACSC’s understanding of adversaries targeting Australia. We want you to join
our team to assist the ACSC to defend against these advanced threats.

These are technical roles, requiring an aptitude for complex problem solving
and the ability to conduct deep analysis of network communications and
endpoint activities to unearth malicious tradecraft.

When not actively hunting, other key responsibilities within the role include
development of documentation and processes such as playbooks, refining your
skills through training opportunities and identifying and enhancing the
capabilities of the team by developing opportunities for automation.

While formal experience in cyber security, specifically Threat Hunting or
Incident Response, is desirable, ASD is also interested in applicants starting
out in this field who have demonstrable experience in software development,
programming or computer sciences, and who are interested in problem solving.
Cyber threat hunting requires analysts to be curious, think outside the box,
have an investigative mindset and be diligent in pursuing leads.
