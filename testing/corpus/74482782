** About Villanova College **

Villanova College is an independent Catholic school for boys under the care of
the Augustinian Order. It was founded in 1948 by five Irish priests on a
10-acre property in Hamilton, with the large onsite residence, called
‘Whinstanes’, functioning as three classrooms, a chapel and sacristy.

The College moved to its present site in Coorparoo in 1954, where it still
sits on the grounds of historic home ‘Langlands’. From 40 students to over
1,500, Villanova has continued to grow into the close community we now cherish
today.

The Augustinian Order has a long history in education reaching back 750 years,
and Villanova has made a love of learning and pursuit of understanding part of
its character since day one. This unrelenting pursuit for knowledge and
understanding ensures our lives will be based on truth, for it is truth that
conquers. This is reflected in the College motto: Vincit Veritas (“Truth
Conquers”).

Villanova College prides itself on being an equal opportunity and family-
friendly workplace. The College employs over 250 staff across a variety of
areas and all staff play a valuable role in supporting the College in making a
difference in each young man’s life.

Our goal is to facilitate a supportive and collegial work environment to
assist staff to produce exceptional outcomes for the young men and for their
own professional development and job satisfaction. The College offers a
variety of different benefits to staff, including opportunities for
professional development, career progression and a wellbeing program. A
distinct feature of our Augustinian values is the strong sense of welcome and
community that unites staff, parents and students. We treasure open, friendly,
and caring relationships between teachers, staff and students, and welcome
people of all faiths and denominations to share our story of hope as we strive
for excellence in boys’ education.
