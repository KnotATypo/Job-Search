  About EcoCommons
 </h2>
 <p>
  The EcoCommons Australia platform is a culmination of a thirteen-year national investment worth $8.45M across multiple partners, positioning the nation for research with impact through effective leveraging of eco-data and eco-analytics. EcoCommons currently provides access to over 60,000 curated datasets—on species, environment and climate—and dynamically updated data-streams through API with major national and international biodiversity data providers. The Platform's existing capabilities span modelling geographic distribution of single/multiple species (land, freshwater or oceans) and species traits, based on environmental features and historical, current, or projected future climates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Software development will look to mature the existing Platform capabilities and operation of EcoCommons Australia and continue alignment with ARDC’s Planet Research Data Commons (Planet RDC) for biodiversity and ecological modelling, specifically under the Modelling, Analytics and Decision Support Infrastructure Program (MADSI).
 </p>
 <p>
