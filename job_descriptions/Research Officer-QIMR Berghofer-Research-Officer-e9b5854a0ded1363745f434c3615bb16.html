   About the Translational Neurogenomics Laboratory:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Translational Neurogenomics Laboratory has identified genetic risk factors for a range of neuropsychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders, schizophrenia, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease. Our current work focuses on translating genetic findings to clinically useful applications. The two key areas of research include: 1) Obtaining an improved understanding of relations between psychiatric disorders and symptoms through phenotypic and genetic modelling; and 2) Identifying more effective treatment for mental health disorders through the identification of compounds that target genetic risk factors.
