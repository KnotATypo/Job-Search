 Established in 2003 MBBC is a P – 12 boys’ school set in the leafy bayside suburb of Manly West. It currently has 500 plus enrolments. At MBBC the Primary School consists of Years Prep to 6 with the Primary School Years 7 – 12. As an International Baccalaureate World school, Moreton Bay Boys’ College offers the great benefits of an internationally recognised approach to education. Our globally-focused syllabus helps boys connect with the world around them – managing, constructing and deconstructing knowledge and applying it to different contexts and experiences. Teachers use the Primary Years Program (PYP) of the International Baccalaureate to plan inquiry-based, differentiated units covering all aspects of the Australian Curriculum. Senior boys follow the QCAA pathways with the majority of boys obtaining an ATAR.
