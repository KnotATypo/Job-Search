  As the name might lead you to believe, we're not doctors, medical researchers, or anything medical for that matter, apart from a few of our customers who are. We’re a passionate bunch of engineers and designers who love leaning into best practices and zombie culture.

  Patient Zero is more a tech company than a consultancy, founded on the knowledge that better decisions, innovation, and problem-solving come from teams of people with diverse viewpoints. We work in teams alongside our customers to design and build custom software.

  We’re looking for an all-rounder in the video content creation space to help us do just that; create video content. Content will span fun and engaging short-form, as well as longer-form case studies and interviews. No idea is a bad idea, we’re looking for someone with a creative mindset and a sense of humour who gets excited over trying new things out.
