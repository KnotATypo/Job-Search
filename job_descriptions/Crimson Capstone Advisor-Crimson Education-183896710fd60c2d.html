     Crimson Capstone Advisor
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <br/>
    As a Crimson Capstone Advisor, you'd be working with students to strategize and develop a personalized leadership project that demonstrates their interests, ingenuity, and initiative. The leadership project is a vital component of their college application process. The core responsibility of an Advisor will be to guide and mentor the student on how to execute their Capstone Project. Advisors will also guide students with the scaling-up of their Capstone Projects as well as ensuring their projects are impactful within a community.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our advisors are paired on a student-by-student basis, with the control to accept or decline students as the mentors schedules allow. This provides our advisors with abilities to manage their schedule around other commitments. The minimum hours required is 5 hours per week, and advisors are obligated to remain with students until their project has come to a close. Allocations are made on the basis of subject compatibility, meaning that you will be working with students hoping to pursue a project in an area similar to your own expertise. Popular project types and subject areas include:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>
      Non-profit/community service
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
