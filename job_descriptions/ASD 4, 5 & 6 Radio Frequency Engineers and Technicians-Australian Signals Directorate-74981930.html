   About the Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As a member of a team within Access Foundations, the successful applicant(s) will be involved in the design, development, testing and integration of RF systems and sub-systems to support ASD’s mission. This is achieved using one or more of the following skills:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Developing, integrating and configuring antennas, and RF sub-systems in hardware or software forms, including software-defined radio (SDR),
  </li>
  <li>
   RF design and testing (using antenna theory, propagation theory, system performance optimisation), and
  </li>
  <li>
   Integration, testing, and evaluation of system and subsystem components, using industry standard test equipment such as spectrum and logic analysers and channel simulators.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  For these roles, ASD requires a mix of specialisation and generalisation across the Radio Frequency design and development skill sets. Whether you are a dedicated RF or software engineer with a passion for designing software based RF solutions, or an RF technician with a love of building, testing, fault finding or integrating bespoke and COTS technologies to deliver customers the products they need, these positions offer you an exciting and rewarding career opportunity.

   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The ideal candidate will work well in a team environment and contribute to the development and growth of the RF engineering capability within ASD. You will be responsible for both supporting our existing products and designing new ones by bringing your ideas and experience to meet our real-world problems. These positions come with capacity to grow into a role where you can detect capability gaps, predict future capability requirements and derive ways to improve our capabilities and work practices. Whether you are an RF or software engineer who enjoys nothing more than designing a new product and seeing that turning into reality or an RF Technician who enjoys product testing and deployment, or you are somewhere in between, these positions offer unique problems for you to solve in a team environment.
