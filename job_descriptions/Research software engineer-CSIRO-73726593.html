 <p>
  Our team uses a combination of maths, computer models and datasets to test, develop and harmonized fundamental concepts and methods that underpin biosecurity science. We are interested in the intersection of science and policy in biosecurity. We are a diverse team, composed of ecologist, social scientist, and software developers that routinely interact with policy makers to achieve better science-based outcomes in biosecurity applied mainly to market access and phytosanitary measures (i.e. quarantine and biosecurity measures).
 </p>
 <p>
  We routinely interact with scientists, policy makers, and industry stakeholders. The team is part of the Pest Management team, within Health and Biosecurity, mostly located in Brisbane.
