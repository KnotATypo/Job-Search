   The Company
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  iAgeHealth is an innovative solution developed by Clinicians in Aged Care, who recognised rural communities fail to have adequate access to multidisciplinary clinical care in a timely manner. Our platform has been designed to harness the latest technological advances and tools to improve access to such crucial health services for older Australians living in regional, rural and remote communities.
 </p>
 <p>
  With diagnostic tools offering live data to clinicians, this role enables you to provide professional care advice from anywhere, at any time. Our Clinicians and Allied Health professionals work on rotating rosters to support a 24/7 service model. Due to the demand of iAgeHealth, our team is expanding and we are welcoming new professionals to be a part of the solution elderly residents need in our rural communities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About the Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Reporting to the iAgeHealth Manager your role involves providing speech pathology services via telehealth to improve a person's quality of life by using a variety of treatments to alleviate issues and restore function or, in the case of permanent injury or disease, to lessen the effects of any dysfunction.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be responsible for ensuring residents have access to high quality speech pathology services which focus on assessment, goal setting and treatment plan creation and intervention, to ensure the best possible outcomes are reached and maintained via the iAgeHealth telehealth platform. Strengthened by an integrated and supportive multidisciplinary team approach (e.g. registered nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and dietitian team members) you will be encouraged to provide residents with person-specific and individualised care.
