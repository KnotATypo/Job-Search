  You will have already graduated in 2022 or 2023 or be eligible for graduation by the end of 2024. Your degree could be from one of the following (but not limited) to:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Engineering: Mining, Mechanical, Mechatronics, Electrical, Mine Geotechnical, Civil, Metallurgy / Minerals Processing, Chemical, Construction Management, Instrumentation Control and Automation, Structural, Quantity Surveying
  </li>
  <li>
   Science: Earth Science / Geology, Hydrogeology, Environmental, Chemistry, Spatial Science (Surveying), GIS
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>

 </ul>
 <p>
  As our graduate opportunities for engineering and science are residentially based near our mining operations or require you to work on a Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) roster, it is important that you'll be willing to consider either of these arrangements to undertake a grad role. Roles such as Technology and Commercial will support our operations from our city locations, but they are never far from the action.

  International students who have a valid visa with no work restrictions are eligible to apply.
