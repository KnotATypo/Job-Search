   About the Company
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  MOA are the leading Quality and Compliance Management SaaS solution in the Australian Aged Care industry. We work with over 1,200 Residential Aged Care Homes in Australia, as well as hundreds of Home and Community Care, Disability Support, and Retirement Living providers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The MOA platform provides streamlined solutions for self-assessment against the Aged Care Quality Standards, NDIS Practice Standards, and a range of other frameworks; as well as supporting care providers in meeting obligations under other programs such as the Serious Incident Response Scheme (SIRS) and the National Aged Care Mandatory Quality Indicator Program (NACMQIP).
 </p>
 <p>
  As of 2023, we're enabling exceptional care around the world, with subsidiaries in New Zealand and the UK.

  <strong>
   About the Role
  </strong>

 <p>
  You will work closely with the Director of Customer Success and Programs Director, applying your knowledge of quality, compliance, and self-assessment processes to ensure each client's MOA program is tailored to their specific needs, and support providers in the ongoing management of their subscriptions. This will involve tailoring MOA's own “off the shelf” self-assessment tools to suit the varying needs of each provider; as well as working alongside providers to configure their custom tools within the platform. You'll also provide guidance on the use of other modules of the MOA platform including our surveys, quality indicator tools, incident management system, plan for continuous improvement, and extensive suite of benchmarked reports.
