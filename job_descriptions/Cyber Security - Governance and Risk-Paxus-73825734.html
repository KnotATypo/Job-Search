  Our client is a large government department in the energy sector. They are currently looking to bring on two Cyber Security Risk Specialists (Data and Information; Governance and Risk).
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Cyber Security Risk Specialist (Data and Information) will provide expert guidance on cyber security risks and risk management, particularly in relation to securing data and information:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Identification, assessment, evaluation and communication of cyber security risk at the enterprise and technical level.
  </li>
  <li>
   Determine the necessary maturity and performance levels for data and information protection cyber security controls and capabilities based on the threat environment, business objectives and risk assessments, and to ensure compliance with cyber security regulations.
  </li>
  <li>
   Define required cyber security controls and their performance and capabilities through frameworks, standards, policies and other artefacts.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
