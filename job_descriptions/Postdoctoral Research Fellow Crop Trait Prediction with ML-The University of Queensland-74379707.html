   About This Opportunity
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  The grains industry has a gross value of &gt; $30 billion per year produced from sowing 25 M ha of crops and is a major export industry for Australia. The Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) uses grower levies to fund more than 800 research, development and extension (RD&amp;E) investments worth $177 million (2022-23). UQ co-invests in grains research including via a new initiative, Analytics for the Australian Grains Industry (AAGI) which involves researchers and students from the Schools of Agriculture and Food Sustainability, Maths and Physics, and Electronic Engineering and Computer Science as well as from QAAFI (Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation - co-funded by the Queensland Government).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AAGI is a five-year strategic partnership across UQ, Curtin University, and the University of Adelaide that is aimed at harnessing analytics to drive the sector's profitability and global impact. AAGI gives Australian growers an opportunity to be world leaders in analytics-driven decision making to drive efficiency and precision and support farm enterprise risk management. AAGI at UQ provides an exciting environment for researchers to focus their efforts on developing their expertise and emerging research profile in their discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is a fixed-term position for up to 3 years. This postdoctoral fellowship position based in the School of Mathematics and Physics will play a lead role in developing crop trait prediction solutions based on physics informed machine learning to allow accurate predictions by combining physical knowledge and data. Methods will include use of deterministic crop models to generate training data for PIML, and testing against observed datasets. In addition to AAGI, this position will service research needs of other UQ and GRDC supported projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key responsibilities will include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Produce quality research outputs consistent with discipline norms by publishing or exhibiting in high quality fora.
  </li>
  <li>
