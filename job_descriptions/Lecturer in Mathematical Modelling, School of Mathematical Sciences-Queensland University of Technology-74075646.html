   About us
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  QUT is a major Australian university with a global outlook and a 'real world' focus. We are an ambitious and collaborative institution that seeks to equip our students and graduates with the skills they will need in an increasingly disrupted and challenged world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The School of Mathematical Sciences (SMS) is a vibrant, multidisciplinary school with extensive teaching and research programs covering the fields of statistics, operations research and applied and computational mathematics. There are currently 29 full-time academic staff members employed in the School, including 10 full Professors, an ARC Laureate Fellow and 2 ARC Discovery Early Career Fellows. Over the past four years 5 staff members were awarded an ARC Discovery Early Career Award, 4 staff were awarded ARC Future Fellowships and 3 professors were in Australia’s top five most highly cited researchers in mathematics in 2016, 2018, and 2019. The School also has two recipients of national teaching excellence awards in mathematics. The School offers programs of study at Bachelors, Honours, Masters (research) and PhD levels. The Bachelor of Mathematics degree offers majors in our three key areas of expertise, namely Statistics, Operations Research and Applied and Computational Mathematics. The SMS hosts a node of the prestigious Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers: Big Data, Big Models, New Insights (ACEMS). The Centre includes over 50 researchers and research students at QUT and almost 100 participants across Australia. In November 2019, QUT officially opened the Centre for Data Science which has a vision to be a national and global leader in the development of frontier methods for the use of data to benefit our world. In collaboration with government and industry, this Centre will draw together capability in data science across Australia to solve global challenges across all sectors. The Centre also has a strong remit in education to provide rigorous training of current and future data scientists. https://www.qut.edu.au/science-engineering/schools/mathematical-sciences.
