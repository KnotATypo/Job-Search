   Product Designer - Clipchamp
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clipchamp is the go-to video platform with one simple mission: to empower anyone to tell stories worth sharing. Since 2016 we’ve attracted over 50 million registered users globally and counting, and that’s only the beginning. We've now joined Microsoft's Office Product Group (OPG)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Building and maintaining strong connections across location and time is critical in the world we live in, and the emotional power of media – video, audio, and photos – makes it perfect for fostering personal connections and sharing information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our in-browser platform and native Windows app gives users access to professional video editing tools and features alongside a 1 million asset-strong stock library and hundreds of editable video templates. We're the go-to platform that's built with everyday editors and creators in mind.
