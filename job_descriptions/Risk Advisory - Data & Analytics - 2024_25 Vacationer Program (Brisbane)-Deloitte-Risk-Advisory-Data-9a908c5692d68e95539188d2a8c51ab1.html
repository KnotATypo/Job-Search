    You’re an absolute data nut. You love working with numbers and large data sets (the more unstructured – the better!). You’re motivated to sift through and unearth patterns and trends, assisting clients navigate risks and capture opportunities with insights from their data.

    <b>
     What will your typical day look like?
    </b>
    <br/>
    No two days are the same in the Regulatory &amp; Compliance team as you help clients understand and navigate complex business issues, organise them with data-driven solution, as well as build and execute on multi-layered data strategies. Through exposure to a variety of real client projects ranging from industrial relations compliance, data risk and governance, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), you will develop a skillset that pairs your technical aptitude with your analytical insight.  On a typical project, you’ll collaborate closely with a team of experts as you source and prepare data for analysis. Then, you’ll dive deep into the data to develop meaningful insights to present back to the client. You will use software like Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to do this, as well as advanced modelling software such as Python and R. Don’t fret, you'll have 100% support from the team as you pick up these new skills and learn industry leading best practice! Once you’ve discovered hidden data insights, you’ll get to develop tailored recommendations and solutions for the client. Pretty cool, right?
