 Just Digital People are currently working with a Brisbane-based, digital agency who are expanding their team as their project work continues to grow and grow.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Reporting to the Head of Digital, you will work alongside a team who are developing projects for a range of clients predominately in WordPress.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 You will need 3+ years commercial experience with WordPress (including custom theme development), PHP &amp; JavaScript.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The perfect person for this role will be someone who loves to think outside the box and is eager to re-think solutions and constantly make improvements so the project is the best it can be. If you have previous experience working in an agency environment this would be a big plus but not essential.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This role is based in Brisbane CBD and does require two to three days a week in the office.
