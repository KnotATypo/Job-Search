   Software engineer: Shaping the future of video
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clipchamp is the go-to video platform with one simple mission: to empower anyone to tell stories worth sharing. Since 2016 we’ve attracted over seventeen million registered users globally and counting, and that’s only the beginning. We've now joined Microsoft's Office Product Group (OPG).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Building and maintaining strong connections across location and time is critical in the world we live in, and the emotional power of media – video, audio, and photos – makes it perfect for fostering personal connections and sharing information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our in-browser platform gives users access to professional video editing tools and features alongside a one million asset-strong stock library and hundreds of editable video templates. We're the video platform that's built with everyday editors and creators in mind.
  <br/>

   About the Team
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Clipchamp is predominantly based in Australia, Office Product Group is a global team with offices in five countries. Joining Clipchamp means you'll join a team of colleagues who live all around the world. We’re committed to each team member feeling connected, regardless of where they work and live.

   Clipchamp’s Technical Stack
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our video editing experience lives completely in-browser, which means pushing the boundaries of what web technologies can do. We hold a high bar for performance and user experience and invest in unique technologies like in-browser file caching, video composition, and video encoders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our frontend codebase is built on React, TypeScript, WebAssembly, ServiceWorkers, and WebGL. On the backend we use Python and are introducing C# for native apps and services. We deploy code to production daily, supported by a culture of automated testing and our dedicated engineering productivity team.
