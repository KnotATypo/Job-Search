 <br/>
 <div>
  <p>
   Are you passionate about building world-class, fast, scalable, container workloads? Are you looking for an opportunity to enable and have great impact on how developers work on these workflows? If you are a mid-level Software Engineer, you can benefit from the unique opportunities that Microsoft offers. You can boost your career, acquire deep technical skills, and discover various possibilities for your future growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   With Azure's continued expansion in containerized workloads and growing customer interest to shift security left, the Azure Container Registry (ACR) team is looking for software engineers who can build from the ground up across the end-to-end system. ACR is chartered with building, storing, securing, scanning, replicating, and managing container images and artifacts with a fully managed, geo-replicated instance of OCI distribution. It is used to connect across environments, including Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Red Hat OpenShift, and across Azure services like App Service, Machine Learning, Azure Security Center, and Batch. We also own services to streamline building, testing, pushing, and deploying images securely to Azure with ACR Tasks. Our team also owns the Microsoft Artifact Registry (MAR), which is Microsoft's primary public registry for distributing 1P and 3P images. Most recently, we’ve been working with the Open Source Community to innovate and experiment to make the registry the best cloud native multi artifact store.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a software engineer on the ACR team, you will have the opportunity to work with various Azure technologies to build and maintain this massively scalable cloud service. You will help design, build, and validate various components needed to maintain, scale, and make Azure Container Registry the best choice for storing images for container workloads. The cloud is becoming ever more important to our lives, and malicious actors getting ever more sophisticated. This opportunity will allow you to be part of an overall vision to secure the supply chain for all workloads running in Azure: from code, to build, to distribution, to runtime - to help Azure be the most secure and most reliable cloud platform. This role offers a flexible work opportunity, so you can work in  our offices to connect with your team and from home. You can be located in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane.
