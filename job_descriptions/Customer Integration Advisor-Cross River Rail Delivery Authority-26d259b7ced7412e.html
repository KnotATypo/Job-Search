  Cross River Rail Delivery Authority (CRRDA)...Your chance to work with the best!
  <br/>
  Cross River Rail will transform the way we travel to, from and through Brisbane in the future. It will be a catalyst for 10 years of wider rail transformation across the whole of South East Queensland and it is already playing a key role in how we prepare for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
  <br/>
  Cross River Rail is a new 10.2km rail line including 5.9km of twin tunnels running under the Brisbane River and CBD. It includes the delivery of four new underground stations, two new above-ground stations, accessibility rebuilds for six stations, the construction of three new stations on the Gold Coast, and the introduction of a new world-class 'ETCS' signalling system.
  <br/>
  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to work on one of Australia's largest infrastructure projects and to be a part of something that will leave a lasting legacy for generations to come.
  <br/>
  About the Role
  <br/>
  As Customer Integration Advisor you support, coordinate and drive positive public transport customer experience outcomes in response to customer impacts such as network changes, station closures and track possessions related to the construction of the Cross River Rail.
  <br/>
  Key to your success will be the preparation of network and customer impact reports, supporting governance meetings, tracking and driving the delivery of project milestones and extensive stakeholder engagement and coordination with internal project teams and multiple external transport agencies.
  <br/>
  Reporting to the Customer and Accessibility Manager and as part of our Customer and Network Integration Team this opportunity is offered as a two year fixed term contract with possible extension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Key Responsibilities:
  </b>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Identify customer impacts due to network changes and communicate with governance groups on the scale of impact based on analysis.
   </li>
   <li>
    Review and interpret technical information, and translate into meaningful insights to inform delivery and drive customer experience improvements.
   </li>
   <li>
    Respond to network changes and challenges by problem solving and collaborating to provide innovative solutions and mitigations that support customers through construction activities.
   </li>
   <li>
    Develop personas and customer journey maps to support understanding of pain points and opportunities associated with network changes.
   </li>
   <li>
    Translate complex information into easily understood visuals or graphics (network maps, diagrams and flowcharts etc).
   </li>
   <li>
    Plan, develop and implement Network Change Customer Plans, Readiness Plans, and provide direction for strategic narratives to support multi-agency customer facing communications development.
   </li>
   <li>
    Assist with governance meetings including strategic forward agenda setting, preparation of supporting presentations and action/decision register management.
   </li>
   <li>
    Collate, monitor and report on the performance and status of program/project activities to support senior management reporting, governance meetings and program integration.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <b>
   About You:
  </b>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Proven track record in customer experience, delivering customer focused outcomes, ideally in a multi-agency environment. Public transport experience is desirable but not essential.
   </li>
   <li>
    Ability to interpret technical and operational documents, data and information to generate accurate and concise insights, briefings and reporting.
   </li>
   <li>
    Strong collaboration and interpersonal skills with the ability to build relationships, influence and engage with a diverse range of stakeholders to meet project deliverables.
   </li>
   <li>
    Highly organised with the ability to adapt and continuously improve systems and processes in a fast paced and changing environment.
   </li>
   <li>
    Excellent problem-solving abilities and accountability.
   </li>
  </ul>
  Why work with CRRDA?
  <br/>
  On Cross River Rail you will not only work with the best but become your best. And as we enter a new phase of delivery, our project offers a rare career opportunity for top tier professionals to have played their part on something that is genuinely city shaping and transformative.
  <br/>
  Our people are supported with flexible work options, career development through the Australian Institute of Management, salary packaging and access to world class employee assistance provider Benestar.
