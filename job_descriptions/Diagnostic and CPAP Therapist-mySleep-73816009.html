 <p>
  Join one of Australia's fastest growing independent Sleep Healthcare providers.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  This exciting new opportunity will allow you to take your career to the next level in a professional, rewarding, and patient focused environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   mySleep have a fantastic opportunity for Full-time staff to join our Southside team
  </strong>
  . Due to the growing demand of our services, we are looking to expand the teams at our Mount Gravatt clinics. Although staff will be cross trained in both Diagnostics and CPAP Therapy, this staff member will have a focus in CPAP.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will work closely with GP’s, Sleep Physicians and Scientists to provide a complete Testing and Treatment Pathway for patients diagnosed with Sleep Apnea.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Diagnostic Technician duties include setting up patients for Diagnostic Home-based Sleep Tests and managing the patient pathway through our testing process. Because the Diagnostics team focuses on the testing and diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea a good understanding of Anatomy and Physiology will assist in the interpretation and communication of the Sleep Reports/Results.
 </p>
 <p>
  The CPAP Therapists and Clinic support duties involve the introduction and ongoing management to patients who have been diagnosed with OSA and require CPAP Therapy. This includes the trial of the equipment, the sale of the equipment and the ongoing management of the Therapy to ensure it is effective in its management of OSA but also ensuring that it is comfortable for the patient. Because this position involves the sale of the equipment, experience in Customer Service and Sales is beneficial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your primary responsibility will be to provide specialized education, equipment, and continued support to our Patients. Our goal as a Healthcare Company is to provide a positive experience for those going through the Diagnostic and CPAP Patient pathway and by doing so improving their quality of life and building an ongoing positive relationship.
 </p>
