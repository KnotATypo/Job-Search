Our mission includes facilitating the transition to a net-zero energy system by 2050, working collaboratively with industry partners to achieve 100% renewable generation capability by 2025.

  <strong>
   About the role
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Sitting within the System Design division the Onboarding and Connections (O&amp;C) department is responsible for the end to end connection process across the National Electricity Market (NEM). Operationally, it works closely with transmission and distribution network service providers in supporting project developers and equipment manufacturers through the application, registration, and commissioning phases of the project lifecycle to enable release to full operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reporting into the Manager Connections Reform this new position will manage and coordinate AEMO’s activities in relation to major connection reform processes, with an initial focus on developing Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) in Queensland, together with broader reforms covering integration of emerging technologies or connections, integration of major network augmentations, streamlining of connection processes, and implementation of regulatory changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The position requires extensive stakeholder management and negotiation of agreed approaches across a variety of conflicting interests. Key stakeholders include Queensland Government, Powerlink (REZ delivery body), generation developers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and industry associations such as the Clean Energy Council (CEC). Consultation and collaboration processes, and their design, will be key to the success of this role. It also requires the coordination of activities and outcomes with other parts of AEMO and industry partners to maximise the ability for this work to feed into other AEMO and industry processes, e.g. Connections Reform Initiative (CRI), Access Standards Review, NSW REZ, Engineering Framework.
 </p>
 <p>
