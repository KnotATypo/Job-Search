   About the Role
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  Do you have superior design skills that you enjoy using as often as possible? Are you passionate about your work – striving to get things perfect with a strong attention to detail? Do enjoy working closely with customers – and relish that feeling you get when you deliver them an exceptional result despite them giving you a confusing or contradictory brief? Are you interested in a role that lets you be both a digital and website designer – allowing you the freedom to undertake different styles of work each day?

  We are currently looking for an experienced designer to join our team. Working within a fun and dynamic team, we want designers who are passionate about the projects they work on and work hard to give clients real world solutions to their business problems, not just graphics that look interesting or shiny shop fronts.
