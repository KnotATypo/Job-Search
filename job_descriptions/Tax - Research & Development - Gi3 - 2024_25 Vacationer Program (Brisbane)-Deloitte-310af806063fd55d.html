  Be part of Australia’s largest cohort of Vacationers – meaning you’ll have a community of other students to lean on and learn from!
  <br/>
  Have a higher chance of being offered a Graduate position - if you impress us and we impress you
  <br/>
  Have a buddy and career coach to give you feedback, support and advice
  <br/>

  If you want to gain exposure in assisting companies access grants and incentives offered by the government in areas such as research and development, innovation, sustainability, regional development and job creation we want to hear from you!
  <br/>
  We won’t give you a career path – we’ll help you shape your own. It’s your time to explore and advance in the areas you find inspirational. Expect purpose, progression, and making an impact that matters. Your story is just beginning, and your green dot is what you make of it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What will your typical day look like?
  <br/>
  Within Deloitte we’re known as Gi3 (Global Investment &amp; Innovation Incentives). No two days are the same in this team. We work with a variety of clients and industries and attend client meetings with managing directors, CFOs, tax managers, heads of R&amp;D, chief scientists, chief technology officers and other key decision makers. You will have opportunity to gain exposure to a variety of clients and industries including Energy &amp; Resources, Agriculture, Biotech and Manufacturing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Who will you be working with?
  <br/>
  We're not your typical tax function. We're a team of engineers, accountants, scientists, lawyers and IP strategists. It’s our job to help clients access incentives and grants. This includes identifying and communicating industry-scale R&amp;D projects on behalf of our clients to the two entities that administer R&amp;D tax incentives — the ATO and AusIndustry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enough about us, let’s talk about you.
  <br/>
  We know that as a student, you may not necessarily have a ton of work experience, and that’s okay! At Deloitte, we recognise potential and want to help you grow more than anything else.
