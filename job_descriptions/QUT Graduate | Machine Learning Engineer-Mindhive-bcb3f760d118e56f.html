     STACK
    </p>
    <p>
     Mindhive uses a reasonably standard Model-View-Controller architecture based on Postgres-Django-Python in the back end and Vue.js in the front end. Application infrastructure is hosted on AWS, and Cloudflare protects from DDoS attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mindhive is currently engaged in several initiatives:
    </p>
    <p>
     Transitioning our AWS environment to “infrastructure as code” based on Terraform. We are taking advantage of this transition to introduce improvements - e.g., streamline updates, agility to plug in AWS smarts, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     We are working towards ISO 27001 compliance. This exercise has prompted sustainability initiatives, including the one above.
    </p>
    <p>
     Code is in BitBucket with CI/CD pipelines. When our “infrastructure as code” initiative is complete, the entire Mindhive stack should be able to be recreated at the push of a button.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, the application Yeah-Nah is coded in Flutter and AWS-Amplify, providing a segue-way for the organisation to move into smartphone apps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Python developers write test cases into the Python code.
    </p>
    <p>
     We currently use Kubernetes. However, this has proven a little complex for a small team to manage so the new Terraform-based environment won’t be using it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Serverless: We already have our toe in the water here (AWS Amplify, two helper functions to do with scanning downloads for malware) and anticipate moving further in that direction when appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Development environment on developer’s workstations (using Docker). Staging and Production on AWS.
    </p>
    <p>
     Use Datadog and Sentry for logging and monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
     User authentication against Auth0.
    </p>
    <p>
     Frontend increasingly uses APIs to communicate with the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Emphasising the use of loose coupling, increasing agility.
