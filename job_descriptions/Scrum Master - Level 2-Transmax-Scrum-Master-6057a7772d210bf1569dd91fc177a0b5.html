   About the role:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Transmax has grown significantly over the last 18 months, and we are not slowing down!
 </p>
 <p>
  We’re in the next exciting stage of our growth phase and looking for our next professional to perform a key role within our Product Development group as a Scrum Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Working as Scrum Master you will perform a key role in facilitating Scrum events (daily Scrum, planning, review and retrospective), and supporting the refinement of product backlog items, for one or more assigned teams. You will interact across our business to collectively stay abreast of agile methodologies, and to improve engagement, collaboration, consistency and effectiveness as industry innovates and practices evolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  This role is an intermediate level; meaning this position takes on some accountability and decision making in day-to-day activities, however, will escalate more complex issues through to a senior level within the organisation, as required.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your day-to-day will see you closely with our Product teams to achieve Agile based outcomes including:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Educating, guiding and supporting product team members in self-organisation, agile principles, and Scrum values.
  </li>
  <li>
   Facilitation of Scrum events for your assigned product teams, at the appropriate cadence including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, spring completion and retro’s.
  </li>
  <li>
   Ensuring product teams have a plan to deliver their sprint increment and take ownership of delivering on sprint commitments.
  </li>
  <li>
   Monitor and report sprint completion, velocity/completion metrics, objective confidence, and other indicators to the leaders within the Product Development group.
  </li>
  <li>
   Collaborate with other Scrum Masters as part of Transmax’s agile community of practice to share knowledge, experiences and provide encouragement.
  </li>
 </ul>
