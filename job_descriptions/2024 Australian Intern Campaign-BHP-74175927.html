   About the Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As BHP Intern, you will be able to apply all you've learnt in real world situations and use your initiative to seek out projects to showcase your capability.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a successful intern you'll get first access to our Australian Graduate Program opportunities or be invited back for another internship if you are in the earlier years of your degree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Opportunities are available in Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What we are looking for
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are looking for people just like you to help produce essential resources for the energy transition, development of infrastructure, and a better world - both now and in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll be a student who is between their second to penultimate year and is able to work with us for 10-12 weeks over the summer break.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be passionate about making a difference and the desire to learn more about the skills required to drive innovation and deliver outcomes as part of a team.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  Your degree could be from one of the following (but not limited) to:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Engineering: Mining, Mechanical, Mechatronics, Electrical, Mine Geotechnical, Civil, Structural, Metallurgy / Minerals Processing, Chemical, Construction Management, Project Management, Instrumentation Control and Automation
  </li>
  <li>
   Science: Earth Science / Geology, Hydrogeology, Environmental, Physics, Chemistry, Spatial Science (Surveying), GIS
  </li>
  <li>

   Technology: Computer Science, Data Science, Cybersecurity, Maths and Statistics
  </li>
  <li>
   Business: Commerce. Finance, Accounting
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
  As our Intern opportunities for engineering and science are residentially based near our mining operations or will require you to work on a Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) roster, it is important that you'll be willing to consider either of these arrangements to undertake an Intern role. Roles such as Technology and Finance will support our operations from our city locations, but they are never far from the action.
 </p>
 <p>
  International students who have a valid visa with no work restrictions for the duration of the internship program are eligible to apply.
