   About the organisation
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Good to Great Schools Australia (GGSA) partners with schools and school systems to support school improvement along a journey from Poor to Fair, Fair to Good and Good to Great.

 <p>
  GGSA is modern and innovative and we are well set up to support roles from being carried at home base

  <strong>
   About the business unit
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  GGSA’s education model is based on the Domains of Childhood, Class, Club, Culture, Civics and Community. Within each domain is a series of programs. Each program has a student learning component, or ‘curriculum’, to support it. GGSA’s model programs are implemented in remote Queensland schools.
 </p>
 <p>
  The team creates curriculum materials for each domain through a range of lessons, assessments, teacher guides and student worksheets. All units follow either explicit instruction (EI) or direct instruction (DI) pedagogical approach, or use a combination of both as required for each subject and program.
