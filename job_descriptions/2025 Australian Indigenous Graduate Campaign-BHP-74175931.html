  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Our award-winning, industry-leading graduate program is looking for graduates who will challenge us, as we will challenge them. You'll complete structured course work, learn on-the-job, rotate into different teams, and contribute to business and technical projects.
  <br/>

  As a BHP Graduate, your 24-month program is a balanced approach to building your technical and professional capabilities through a structured program. When you start, you'll be given a buddy who will show you the ropes and gain access to our mentor program to help shape your career.

 <p>
  We are looking for people just like you to help produce essential resources for the energy transition, development of infrastructure, and a better world - both now and in the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will have already graduated in 2022 or 2023 or be eligible for graduation by the end of 2024. Your degree could be from one of the following (but not limited) to:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
   Science: Earth Science / Geology, Hydrogeology, Environmental, Chemistry, Spatial Science (Surveying), GIS
  </li>
  <li>
   Health Science: Safety, Health, Nursing, Paramedical Science

  </li>
  <li>
   Business: Commerce. Finance, Accounting, Law, Economics
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
  As our graduate opportunities for engineering and science are residentially based near our mining operations or require you to work on a Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) roster, it is important that you'll be willing to consider either of these arrangements to undertake a grad role. Roles such as Technology and Commercial will support our operations from our city locations, but they are never far from the action.
