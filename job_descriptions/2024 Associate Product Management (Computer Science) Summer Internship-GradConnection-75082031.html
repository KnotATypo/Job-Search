   Atlassian can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Assuming you have eligible working rights and a sufficient time zone overlap with your team, you can choose to work remotely or from an office (unless it’s necessary for your role to be performed in the office). Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Atlassian’s Associate Product Manager (APM) internship program is designed to start growing ambitious, creative all-rounders into the next generation of global product leaders.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every APM intern gets to work on projects that are important to Atlassian, like building features for brand-new products, brainstorming high-impact ideas, and running experiments to improve the customer experience. You’ll get a feel for life as a Product Manager, while also getting a close look into what it’s like to be a full-time member of our APM Program when you graduate. Most importantly, the APM internship is 12 weeks spent doing real work with us, as a respected member of the team.
 </p>
 <p>
  This program is open to penultimate-year university students with Australian or New Zealand citizenship or Permanent Residency. The internship dates are late November 2024 to late February 2025, full-time for 12 weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  Applicants must also have Australian or New Zealand citizenship or Permanent Residency at the time of application.
