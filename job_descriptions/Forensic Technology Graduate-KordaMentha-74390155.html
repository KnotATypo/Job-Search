 </ul>
 <p>
  But it’s not all about work. You’ll be given a buddy to help you navigate office life as you settle in. You’ll choose a mentor who will help guide your career. We host regular events and activities, bringing together our close-knit team in a friendly and relaxed environment so you can get to know the people behind the professionals. You’ll also become a member of Accelerate, our young professionals networking group.
 </p>
