    Data is swiftly overtaking physical assets in terms of value to organizations.

The Master Data management steward is responsible for enabling the successful delivery of the QUT master data management initiative. By adapting and following the data quality and master data management framework and policies, Master Data management steward makes sure that the trusted data is accessible and available for sound decision making in
addition to the integrity of processes and supporting applications relating to students and staff throughout their lifecycle. This role supports the MDM development and implementation, improving the trust in data by providing support and training to the data owners, data custodians and data stewards of the core applications in the scope of QUT master data management.
The master data management steward will work with stakeholders in the business units from across the University as well as the Compliance Team, the Data &amp; Analytics Team, Enterprise Architecture, Business Process Improvement and relevant third parties to participate in the design and delivery of the master data management program to improve trust in data, to support the development of a sustainable MDM program within QUT core systems and business processes.
