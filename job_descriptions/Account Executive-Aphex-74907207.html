  About Aphex:
 </h2>
 <p>
  At Aphex (https://www.aphex.co/), we believe that construction teams' tools to plan and communicate their work should have stayed in 1995.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's why we are on a mission to make it easier for construction teams to get on the same page with a live, multiplayer planning platform. Instead of the current mountain of spreadsheets, whiteboards, and stone tablets, we build tools that allow anyone on a project to plan and communicate their work with complete visibility of everyone working around them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our customers are the largest construction contractors, building the tunnels, roads, bridges, and buildings we use daily. Our users are the engineers managing and planning these incredible projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  We're at an exciting stage of our journey. Having launched our V1 in the UK in 2019, we power most major contractors and projects today. We entered the Australian market in 2022 and have replicated that success as the leading solution. As a team, we have found initial product market fit, have proven we can expand across international markets, and are in the early stages of scaling our go-to-market team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Join us on a mission to improve an industry that contributes to around 10% of GDP but is less productive than 20 years ago… It's kind of a big issue.
 </p>
 <h2>
  The Role:
 </h2>
 <p>
  This is an opportunity to become a foundational part of our sales team (the 3rd overall outside of 2 founder-sales).
 </p>
 <p>
  It is a perfect role for someone hungry to show what they can do in a full-cycle sales role. We have taken the time to validate playbooks and prove that we can onboard new folks to be successful.
 </p>
 <p>
  For an ambitious sales professional, it is excellent timing. It is late enough so there is structure and proven playbooks that drive inbound leads and early enough to run in a lot of open field.
 </p>
 <p>
  Key Responsibilities:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Execute and iterate your version of our playbooks.
  </li>
  <li>
   Execute bottom-up and top-down demand strategies to acquire project-level customers, then tie them together in an enterprise strategy.
  </li>
  <li>
   Build and nurture strong relationships with key decision-makers and influencers within target accounts.
  </li>
  <li>
   Conduct killer product demonstrations.
  </li>
  <li>
   Negotiate contracts and close deals.
  </li>
  <li>
   Partner with customer success teams to ensure a smooth onboarding process for new clients
  </li>
  <li>
   Achieve quarterly and annual sales targets.
  </li>
 </ul>
