 This role is for a Junior-Mid level developer who has built up some strong skills and experience using Wordpress and are ready to take things to the next level.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At this well-established agency you will work on a variety of projects and across a range of small-medium sized clients – there will be plenty of chances to learn, grow and be exposed to new challenges. Your experience with Wordpress will be key to your success in this role, but so will your adaptability and willingness to pick up new skills. Existing working knowledge with Shopify, PHP or React/Vue will be an advantage in this team – support and training will be offered to those that need it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There will be a lot of support provided when you join, so initially you’ll need to work 5 days in the office to take it all in. After you’re up to speed you’ll have the flexibility of a hybrid working arrangement, with most of the team coming into the office 1-2 days a week to connect and collaborate on projects.
