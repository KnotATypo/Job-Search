    Job Summary
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   We are seeking a Lead Exploration Systems Analyst to join Geologic &amp; Interpret Applications Division of Exploration Applications Services Department. The Geological &amp; Interpretation Applications Division (GIAD) core responsibilities include support of a large user base in Exploration with wide range of geoscience applications, technologies and solutions spanning the whole upstream spectrum from Exploration to Development. As Oil and Gas exploration and reservoir development in Saudi Arabia has moved to higher levels of complexity and more challenging frontiers, GIAD is committed to acquire and develop state of the art technologies and to hire the best-in-class geoscientists to meet the growing energy demand. The Lead Exploration Systems Analyst primary role is to develop workflows that integrates multidisciplinary upstream data utilizing mainstream Geological and Geophysical (G&amp;G) software platforms, such as SIS Petrel and Landmark DecisionSpace Geoscience (DSG) among multiple other specialized software. The candidate will work closely with exploration and development geologists, geophysicists, geo-modelers, and petrophysicists leveraging an in-depth experience in industry-leading G&amp;G software to conduct advanced basin and reservoir characterization studies.
