      About Genomics, Imaging, and AI Laboratory:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Genomics, Imaging, and AI Laboratory at QIMR Berghofer is part of the Population Health Program. With a primary focus on neurodegenerative disorders of the eye and brain, the lab employs statistical genetics and artificial intelligence (particularly machine learning) methodologies to advance gene discovery and improve risk prediction for these diseases. The lab also boasts exciting collaborations with industry partners in both clinical and ML analytical domains.

     <strong>
      Role Purpose / Responsibilities:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     We are recruiting a highly motivated and organised PhD student to contribute to research studies focused on neurodegenerative diseases affecting the eye and brain, such as glaucoma, dementia, and Parkinson's disease. Early detection and intervention play a crucial role in managing the risks for developing these conditions. Our ongoing studies utilise machine learning and statistical methods to analyse existing ocular and neuroimaging data. We aim to enhance the prediction of risks associated with these conditions. If you have a passion for research along with expertise in artificial intelligence and data analysis, we invite you to apply for this opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
     The main responsibilities are;
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Develop and implement research projects under the guidance of study supervisors.
     </li>
     <li>
      Analyse large-scale eye and brain imaging data using appropriate machine learning and statistical methods.
     </li>
     <li>
      Interpret results and draw conclusions based on the data analysis.
     </li>
     <li>
      Report to the Principal Supervisor and work from the QIMR Berghofer location.
     </li>
     <li>
      Prepare research findings for publication in peer-reviewed journals.
     </li>
     <li>
      Present research findings at conferences and workshops.
     </li>
     <li>
      Stay updated on current literature and research developments in the field.
     </li>
     <li>
      Effectively manage project timelines, milestones, and deliverables while maintaining detailed records of research activities and progress.
     </li>
     <li>
      Work effectively as part of a research team, and collaborate with other researchers, both within and outside the organization.
     </li>
     <li>
      Ensure that all research activities adhere to ethical standards and compliance requirements.
     </li>
