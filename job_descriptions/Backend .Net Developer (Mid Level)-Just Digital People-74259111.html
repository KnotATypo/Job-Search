 We have a great opportunity for a Mid Level Developer who has a love for backend development.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For this role, we are looking for someone with at least 3 years commercial experience, ideally focussed in the backend.

 You'll need prior experience with:
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Development and deployment of backend microservices and APIs using .Net Core, C# and Terraform.
  </li>
  <li>
   Azure Cloud components.
  </li>
  <li>
   Software testing.
  </li>
  <li>
   Working within Agile environments.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 If you are looking for a place where you can genuinely be appreciated for your quality of work alongside a laid back and supportive team, then this is the company for you! They have a very social team as well and have a number of fun events you can attend through the year and an on-site gym!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This company is also well known for providing their developers with internal development opportunities as well.
