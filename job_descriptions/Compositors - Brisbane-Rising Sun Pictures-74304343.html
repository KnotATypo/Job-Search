     Position Overview
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Reporting to Compositing Supervisor and the Head of 2d, you will be responsible for creating multi-layered composites for live action feature films. Applicants presenting highly realistic, live-action composites (rather than stylised full-CG composites) in their portfolio, will have their application reviewed with priority. RSP is a Nuke based effects facility operating in a Linux system environment.
   </p>
   <p>
    You are a professional artist who works collaboratively with your team and those working in other departments. You are an excellent time manager and forward thinker who delivers to schedule and to brief. You have previously been responsible for creating complex composites that incorporate naturalistic effects simulation, environments and matte painting and native live action elements.
   </p>
   <p>
    Your ability to own your work from turnover to delivery will be highly regarded by your previous supervisors. As a professional compositor, you continually provide confidence to your production team through regular updates. You maintain clarity and focus when crunch time hits and know what is expected of you. You maintain a good working relationship with artists delivering assets to you and remain proactive in resolving any issues which may impede shot delivery.
