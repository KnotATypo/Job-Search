    Amazon’s Brisbane based software engineering teams own the critical last  hop in outbound fulfillment of customer orders. The features you build  have direct impact on customers lives. You will work with scientists and  engineers to optimize fulfillment processes, reducing costs and  improving quality. You will experiment with new ideas, turning the  successful ones into full production systems whilst failing fast and  learning from those which are not. We obsess over reducing the time and  cost in fulfilling a customer's order.
