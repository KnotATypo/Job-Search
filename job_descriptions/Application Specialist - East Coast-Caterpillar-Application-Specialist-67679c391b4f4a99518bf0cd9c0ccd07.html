     Job Description
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    At Caterpillar, we value our people and are committed to providing challenging and fulfilling careers. Joining the Caterpillar technology team opens the door to a number of career opportunities that are not traditionally available in the mining sector. We are seeking motivated and versatile individuals to join our team, working with a key customer at their remote mine. This role’s roster will align to that of our customers and may adjust based on which project you are currently focused on.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our Application Specialists play a key role in ensuring the Command for Hauling system is working at its optimum performance, using your specialist knowledge and experience. You will focus on supporting the MineStar fleet management application for the customer’s autonomous haulage fleet, with a focus on maximizing performance. You will partner with our On-board Specialists who focus on the hardware to ensure the customer is operating at optimised system availability. You will troubleshoot issues impacting performance, and work with key Caterpillar teams in product support to identify, document and provide solutions for ongoing product improvements.
   </p>
   <p>
    This role would suit someone with strong operational mining or fleet management experience who is looking to balance that knowledge with some computer-based analytics. Ensuring the Command for hauling system application is configured, maintained and operated to Caterpillar specifications and best practice. Coaching and mentoring of customer personnel on interaction and operation of the Command for Hauling system application are also key aspects of the role.
   </p>
   <p>
    We will offer you a dynamic team environment with great opportunities for personal development. Your career as an Autonomous Application Specialist can offer training and operational experience enriched by international networking and collaboration.
