  About the Role
 </strong>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Technical delivery for designing, building, and maintaining optimised and highly available data infrastructure, pipelines, and workflows that facilitate data management, data analytics, and modelling solutions. The role plans, designs, develops, deploys, and administers frameworks and architectural approaches that scale to handle user demands.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a hands-on role which requires technical expertise to deliver data and analytical services including data ingestion, transformation, storage, dashboarding, and model execution.  The role strives to continuously develop new and improved data engineering and operations capabilities.

 <p>
  The incumbent may exclusively support major projects or programs such as EcoCommons Australia.
 </p>
 <strong>
  About EcoCommons
 </strong>
 <br/>
 <p>
  The EcoCommons Australia platform is a culmination of a thirteen-year national investment worth $8.45M across multiple partners, positioning the nation for research with impact through effective leveraging of eco-data and eco-analytics. EcoCommons currently provides access to over 60,000 curated datasets—on species, environment and climate—and dynamically updated data-streams through API with major national and international biodiversity data providers. The Platform's existing capabilities span modelling geographic distribution of single/multiple species (land, freshwater or oceans) and species traits, based on environmental features and historical, current, or projected future climates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Software development will look to mature the existing Platform capabilities and operation of EcoCommons Australia and continue alignment with ARDC’s Planet Research Data Commons (Planet RDC) for biodiversity and ecological modelling, specifically under the Modelling, Analytics and Decision Support Infrastructure Program (MADSI).
