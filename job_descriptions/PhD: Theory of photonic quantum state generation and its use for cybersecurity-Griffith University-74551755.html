   About us
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Griffith University’s Centre for Quantum Dynamics (CQD) undertakes world-leading research in quantum science and technology.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Centre comprises more than 40 researchers—including theorists and experimentalists—with strong collaborations. Our cutting-edge research encompasses many areas, including quantum information processing, quantum foundations, ultrafast quantum processes, and quantum biophysics. The Centre hosts a node of the Australian Research Council’s Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology and is also home to the Australian Attosecond Science Facility, the only laboratory in Australia where atoms, molecules and materials can be probed on sub-femtosecond timescales.
 </p>
 <strong>
  Job Description
 </strong>
 <p>
  We are currently looking for a PhD candidate to work in quantum information theory. The primary focus of this role is to contribute to an externally funded project about photonic quantum state generation and quantum non-locality.
 </p>
 <p>
  This project includes analytic theory, coding, and simulations in quantum optics and quantum information. Success in this role requires collaboration with an immediate team consisting of Dr Travis Baker, Dr Nora Tischler, and Prof Howard Wiseman; further collaborations are also likely with an extended network of physicists in Australia and across the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  As part of this project, there will be opportunities to travel to conferences, and to undertake a research stay in the USA.
 </p>
 <strong>
  Qualifications
 </strong>
 <p>
