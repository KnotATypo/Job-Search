You’ll help provide training and education to our customers about how to interpret flood intelligence results so that they can make better decisions, in real time.  You’ll work with industry-standard technologies to build benchmarking models, but you’ll also be exposed to new cutting edge technologies. You’ll learn how to use python to accomplish complex tasks easily. You’ll learn SQL to allow you to access surface water records spanning hundreds of years, a dozen agencies, and two continents.
