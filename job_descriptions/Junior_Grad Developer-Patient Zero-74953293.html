  As the name might lead you to believe, we're not doctors, medical researchers, or anything medical for that matter, apart from a few of our customers who are. We’re a passionate bunch of engineers and designers who love leaning into best practices and zombie culture.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Patient Zero is more a tech company than a consultancy, founded on the knowledge that better decisions, innovation, and problem-solving come from teams of people with diverse viewpoints. We work in teams alongside our customers to design and build custom software.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  We’re tech agnostic and full-stack, covering TypeScript and C#, ReactJS, NodeJS and .NET Core but also some iOS/Android Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot and much more. We always aim for the right implementation using microservices, K8S and Docker, Serverless architecture and DevSecOps principles.
