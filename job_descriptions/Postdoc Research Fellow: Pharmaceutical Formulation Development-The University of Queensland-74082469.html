   About This Opportunity
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  We are seeking a talented and highly motivated
  <strong>
   Postdoctoral Research Fellow
  </strong>
  to join the world-leading research team at our School of Pharmacy to undertake research and development into the formulation, optimisation and evaluation of a range of liquid and semi-solid dosage forms for nasal delivery. This will include the design and delivery of rigorous formulation optimisation and stability evaluation studies, working towards GMP standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This role, within a NHMRC-funded program, will involve developing novel drug-infused solution/semi-solid formulations with appropriate pharmaceutical properties for application in drug retention and drug release studies as determined via HPLC/LC-MS analysis. The lead formulations will then be assessed in a simulated 3D nasal inhalation model, and via extensive
