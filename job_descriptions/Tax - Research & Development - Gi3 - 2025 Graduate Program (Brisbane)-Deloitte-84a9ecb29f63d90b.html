   Description:
  </b>
  <br/>
  Be part of Australia’s largest cohort of graduates – meaning you’ll have a community of other grads to lean on and learn from!
  <br/>
  Be supported in further study and professional development like industry certifications, postgraduate study
  <br/>
  Have a buddy and career coach to give you feedback, support and advice
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you want to gain exposure in assisting companies access grants and incentives offered by the government in areas such as research and development, innovation, sustainability, regional development and job creation we want to hear from you!
  <br/>
  We won’t give you a career path – we’ll help you shape your own. It’s your time to explore and advance in the areas you find inspirational. Expect purpose, progression, and making an impact that matters. Your story is just beginning, and your green dot is what you make of it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What will your typical day look like?
  <br/>
  Within Deloitte we’re known as Gi3 (Global Investment &amp; Innovation Incentives). No two days are the same in this team. We work with a variety of clients and industries and attend client meetings with managing directors, CFOs, tax managers, heads of R&amp;D, chief scientists, chief technology officers and other key decision makers. You will have opportunity to gain exposure to a variety of clients and industries including Energy &amp; Resources, Agriculture, Biotech and Manufacturing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Who will you be working with?
  <br/>
  We're not your typical tax function. We're a team of engineers, accountants, scientists, lawyers and IP strategists. It’s our job to help clients access incentives and grants. This includes identifying and communicating industry-scale R&amp;D projects on behalf of our clients to the two entities that administer R&amp;D tax incentives — the ATO and AusIndustry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enough about us, let’s talk about you.
  <br/>
  We know that as a student, you may not necessarily have a ton of work experience, and that’s okay! At Deloitte, we recognise potential and want to help you grow more than anything else.

  At Deloitte, we focus our energy on interesting and impactful work. We’re always learning, innovating and setting the standard; making a positive difference to our clients and our society. We put coaching at the heart of what we do, helping our people grow their careers in any direction – whether it be up, moving into something new, or even moving across the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We embrace diversity, equity and inclusion. We have a diverse collection of people from different backgrounds, with different experiences, gender identities, abilities and thinking styles. What binds us together is a shared commitment to value everyone’s perspective and to cultivate inclusion; so that our work environment is a safe space we can all belong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We prioritise flexibility and choice. At Deloitte, you get trust on Day 1. We know our people get their best work done when they’re in control of where and how they work, designing their work week around their client, team and personal commitments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
