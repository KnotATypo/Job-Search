We are a matured operational team that not only responds to security events, incidents, and triggers, but a fully-fledged operational team that hunts for anomalous, suspicious, and potentially unwanted activities within our customers environments.
 </p>
 <p>
  We partner with industry leaders to provide our services and to provide you with a broad technical skillset, certifications and experience.

  We are looking for a mix of Analysts ranging from junior to senior level of experience who are keen to explore the next step in their career.

  <strong>
   About the Role (Your Why)
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The core objectives and responsibilities of the Cybersecurity Analyst include analysing security events of interest. The analyst is responsible for overseeing incidents from initiation through to resolution and identifying opportunities for alert refinement. By utilising defensive measures and insights gathered from diverse sources, the Cybersecurity Analyst identifies, analyses, and reports on events transpiring or potentially unfolding within the network. This proactive approach aims to safeguard information, information systems, and networks from potential threats.
